# SPEC — Deterministic Topological Generative Layout (D‑TGL) Engine · BIM3.0

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | **Draft — normative target.** The offline, deterministic generative layout engine; the non‑AI substrate of the Apartment Layout Generator (#51) and the foundation of PRYZM's BIM3.0 generative stack. |
| Version | 0.1 (2026‑05‑25) |
| Owner | Computational design / BIM3.0 architecture |
| Governed by | C09 (AI & generative L7.5), C15 (hosted openings), C16 (command authoring), SPEC‑APARTMENT‑LAYOUT‑GENERATOR (the consumer), C03 (schemas/state) |
| Hard constraints | **Deterministic** (same input → byte‑identical output), **synchronous in‑browser < 2 s**, **unit‑testable**, **no stochastic methods** (no NSGA‑II, no Monte‑Carlo, no `Math.random`), **no Voronoi** for interior orthogonal layouts. |

> D‑TGL turns a **shell polygon + a program brief** into **K Pareto‑ranked interior
> layouts**, each materialised as **both** (a) geometry (walls + hosted doors) and
> (b) a **persistent semantic graph** (spaces, boundaries, connections) that is
> IFC5‑/RDF‑ready and queryable post‑generation. The graph is the product; the
> geometry is a projection of it. That is what makes this **BIM3.0, not BIM2.0**:
> the model is a typed, linked knowledge graph, not a bag of meshes.

## §1 — Algorithm name & academic lineage

**Name:** *Deterministic Topological Generative Layout* (**D‑TGL**) — more fully:

> **Rectilinear Dissection + Squarified Slicing‑Tree Subdivision + Space‑Syntax‑Weighted Deterministic Pareto Enumeration, over a persistent topological space graph.**

**Lineage (each phase cites its source):**

- **Rectilinear polygon partition / dissection** — computational geometry; vertical‑slab sweep decomposition of rectilinear (and slant‑approximated) polygons. *(Lipski et al.; Ohtsuki — minimum rectangular partition.)*
- **Slicing‑tree floorplanning** — VLSI placement; recursive guillotine subdivision. *(Otten 1982, "Automatic floorplan design"; Wong & Liu slicing trees.)*
- **Squarified treemaps** — area‑proportional subdivision with aspect‑ratio minimisation. *(Bruls, Huizing & van Wijk 2000.)*
- **Bubble diagrams / architectural programming** — adjacency requirement graphs. *(classic; formalised in Michalek & Papalambros 2002, "Interactive design optimization of architectural layouts".)*
- **Space Syntax** — justified graph, mean depth, Relative Asymmetry, Integration. *(Hillier & Hanson 1984, "The Social Logic of Space"; Bafna 2003.)*
- **Deterministic multi‑objective ranking** — finite candidate enumeration + Pareto non‑domination (explicitly **NOT** NSGA‑II): the candidate set is small and seeded by fixed strategies, so the Pareto front is computed by exact dominance, not stochastic evolution.

This is the family that production tools (TestFit, Hypar, Spacemaker) approximate; D‑TGL keeps the deterministic, testable members and discards the stochastic ones for an in‑browser engine.

## §2 — Phased pipeline (modules, I/O, data contracts)

All modules are PURE (no DOM/THREE/network), live under
`packages/ai-host/src/workflows/apartmentLayout/tgl/`, operate in **metres, plan
frame `{x, z}`** (z = world Z = plan "up"), and round to 1e‑6 m at boundaries.

| Phase | Module | Input → Output | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1** | `rectDecomposition.ts` | `Pt[]` shell polygon → `Rect[]` (axis‑aligned, slab sweep) | ✅ 8 tests |
| **P2** | `bubbleGraph.ts` | `ApartmentProgram`, availableAreaM2 → `BubbleGraph` (rooms + targets + adjacency edges) | ✅ 6 tests |
| **P3a** | `squarify.ts` | `Rect`, `AreaItem[]` → `PlacedItem[]` (squarified treemap) | ✅ 6 tests |
| **P3b** | `subdivide.ts` | `Rect[]` + `BubbleGraph` → `RoomPlacement[]` (rooms→footprints; pack across rects, squarify each, corridor cell) | ✅ 5 tests |
| **P4** | `wallsAndDoors.ts` | `RoomPlacement[]` + `BubbleGraph` → `{ segments: WallSeg[]; openings: OpeningSpec[] }` (dedup shared walls; doors on realised adjacencies) | ✅ 5 tests |
| **P5** | `semanticGraph.ts` | `RoomPlacement[]`+`WallSeg[]`+`OpeningSpec[]`+`BubbleGraph` → `LayoutGraph` (the persistent BIM3.0 graph; §3) | ✅ 6 tests (+4 `ifcGuid`) |
| **P6** | `spaceSyntax.ts` | `LayoutGraph` → `SyntaxMetrics` (per‑space depth, mean depth, RA, integration; §4) | ✅ 5 tests |
| **P7** | `objectives.ts` | `LayoutGraph`+`SyntaxMetrics`+`BubbleGraph` → `ObjectiveVector` (5 raw axes; §4 — weights applied in P8) | ✅ 5 tests |
| **P8** | `enumerate.ts` | shell+program+constraints → `ScoredLayoutOption[]` (run P1–P7 over a fixed strategy set; Pareto‑rank; §2.2) | ⏳ |
| **P9** | `emitGeometry.ts` | `LayoutGraph` → `LayoutOption` (mm `{x,y}` walls+doors for `buildLayoutCommands`) | ⏳ |
| **P10** | `ifc5/` | `LayoutGraph` → IFC5 + RDF/OWL (§5) | ⏳ (post‑MVP) |

### §2.1 — Data contracts between phases

```ts
// P1
interface Pt { x: number; z: number }                 // metres, plan frame
interface Rect { x0; z0; x1; z1 }                      // x0<x1, z0<z1

// P2
interface ProgramRoom { id; type: RoomType; name; targetAreaM2; isPrivate; needsWindow }
interface AdjacencyEdge { a: id; b: id; via: 'open'|'door' }
interface BubbleGraph { rooms: ProgramRoom[]; edges: AdjacencyEdge[]; corridorId; entryId }

// P3b
interface RoomPlacement { roomId: id; rect: Rect }     // footprint for each ProgramRoom

// P4
interface WallSeg { id; a: Pt; b: Pt; thickness; boundsRoomIds: id[] }   // ≤2 rooms ⇒ interior shared/exterior
interface OpeningSpec { id; wallId; type:'door'|'window'; offsetM; widthM; heightM; sillM; betweenRoomIds:[id,id?] }

// P5 — the persistent graph (see §3)
interface LayoutGraph { nodes: GraphNode[]; edges: GraphEdge[]; meta: { shellArea; levelId; seed } }

// P6/P7
interface SyntaxMetrics { perSpaceDepth: Record<id, number>; meanDepth; integration: Record<id, number> }
interface ObjectiveVector { efficiency; adjacency; daylight; circulation; regularity }  // each 0..1, higher better
```

**Contract invariant (every phase):** outputs are a pure function of inputs; no
hidden global reads; arrays are returned in a **stable, sorted order** (never
Map/Set iteration order — see §6).

### §2.2 — Deterministic Pareto enumeration (the NSGA‑II replacement)

P8 runs the P1–P7 pipeline over a **fixed, finite strategy set** `S` (e.g.
`{ sliceMajorAxis: [x, z] } × { publicZone: [low, high] } × { corridorSide: [a, b] }`
→ ~8 candidates). Each candidate yields an `ObjectiveVector`. We then:

1. Compute the **Pareto‑non‑dominated set** by exact dominance (a dominates b iff
   ≥ on every axis and > on one).
2. Rank the front by the **weighted sum** of the (weight‑normalised) objectives.
3. Return the top `count`.

No populations, no mutation, no RNG → identical output every run. The strategy set
is the only "search"; it is enumerated, not evolved.

## §3 — Persistent semantic graph schema (what makes it BIM3.0)

The engine's primary output is `LayoutGraph` — a typed property graph that
**persists after geometry generation** and is the single source of truth. Geometry
(walls/doors) is emitted from it (P9); analyses (cost/energy/structure) attach to
it without regeneration (the digital‑twin bridge).

### §3.1 — Node types

| Node | Maps to (IFC5) | Key properties (Pset) |
|---|---|---|
| `Space` | `IfcSpace` | `guid`, `spaceType` (IfcSpaceTypeEnum + our RoomType), `name`, `netAreaM2`, `targetAreaM2`, `isPrivate`, `windowCount`, `polygon: Pt[]` |
| `Wall` | `IfcWall` / `IfcWallStandardCase` | `guid`, `baseLine:[Pt,Pt]`, `thickness`, `heightM`, `isExternal`, `loadBearing?` |
| `Opening` | `IfcOpeningElement` | `guid`, `hostWall: wallGuid`, `offsetM`, `widthM`, `heightM`, `sillM` |
| `Door` | `IfcDoor` | `guid`, `opening: openingGuid`, `widthM`, `heightM`, `operation` |
| `Window` | `IfcWindow` | `guid`, `opening`, `widthM`, `sillM` |
| `Level` | `IfcBuildingStorey` | `guid`, `elevationM`, `name` |

### §3.2 — Edge types

| Edge | Maps to (IFC5) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `BOUNDS` (Wall→Space) | `IfcRelSpaceBoundary` (2nd level) | a wall is a boundary of a space |
| `ADJACENT_TO` (Space↔Space) | `IfcRelSpaceBoundary` (shared element) | two spaces share a wall |
| `CONNECTS_THROUGH` (Space↔Space, via Door) | `IfcRelConnectsElements` + door | circulation link (a door) — the **Space‑Syntax edge** |
| `HOSTED_BY` (Opening→Wall) | `IfcRelVoidsElement` | opening voids its host wall (C15 cascade) |
| `FILLS` (Door/Window→Opening) | `IfcRelFillsElement` | element fills the opening (C15) |
| `CONTAINS` (Level→Space/Wall) | `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` | spatial containment |

### §3.3 — Property sets (extensibility for the digital twin)

Each node carries an open `psets: Record<string, Record<string, Primitive>>`. The
generator populates `Pset_SpaceCommon` (area, type, occupancy) etc.; downstream
twin services **add** psets (`Pset_ThermalLoad`, `Pset_CostEstimate`,
`Pset_StructuralLoad`) **without touching geometry** — they query the graph by
node type/edge and attach. The graph is append‑only‑friendly: regeneration is
never required to enrich it.

### §3.4 — Stable identity (IfcGUID)

Every node has a **deterministic** `guid` (§6): `ifcGuid(seed, role, index, geomKey)`
— a base64 IFC‑compressed GUID derived from a stable FNV‑1a hash of those inputs.
Re‑running the generator on the same input reproduces the same GUIDs (so diffs,
versioning, and twin links are stable). **Never `crypto.randomUUID()` here.**

---

## §4 — Space Syntax integration → Pareto scorer

**Where it attaches:** P6 consumes the `LayoutGraph`'s `CONNECTS_THROUGH` edges
(doors) + `ADJACENT_TO` (open thresholds) as the **justified graph**; the root is
the `Space` linked to the entrance (`entryId`).

**Computation (deterministic BFS):**
- `depth(s)` = graph distance (in connection steps) from the entrance space.
- `meanDepth (MD)` = Σ depth(s) / (n − 1).
- `RelativeAsymmetry (RA)` = 2(MD − 1) / (n − 2).
- `Integration(s)` = 1 / RRA(s), RRA = RA / D\_n (Hillier's normalisation constant).

**Feeds the 5‑axis `ObjectiveVector` (P7):**

| Axis | Formula (higher = better) | Uses |
|---|---|---|
| `efficiency` | 1 − corridorArea / totalArea | geometry |
| `adjacency` | (satisfied bubble edges) / (required edges) | graph vs `BubbleGraph` |
| `daylight` | Σ area(spaces with window) / totalArea | window proximity to façade |
| `circulation` | normalised **mean‑depth** term — *shallower public, deeper private* (reward low MD for `living`/`hall`, high depth for `bedroom`/`bathroom`) | **Space Syntax MD/integration** |
| `regularity` | mean(min(w,h)/max(w,h)) over spaces (aspect→1) + wall‑axis alignment | geometry/structure |

`circulation` is the direct Space‑Syntax injection: a layout where bedrooms are
shallow (off the entrance) and the living room is deep scores **low**; the
architecturally‑correct gradient (public shallow, private deep) scores **high**.

---

## §5 — IFC5 / RDF mapping layer (P10)

Attaches at the **end** (consumes the finished `LayoutGraph`); never mid‑pipeline,
so the geometry phases stay export‑agnostic.

- **IFC5** (`tgl/ifc5/toIfc5.ts`): node/edge → the IFC5 entity table in §3.1/§3.2.
  IFC5 is the ECS/graph‑native schema, so our property graph maps **1:1** (no
  lossy flattening): `Space`→`IfcSpace`, `ADJACENT_TO`→`IfcRelSpaceBoundary`,
  `CONNECTS_THROUGH`→door + `IfcRelConnectsElements`, psets→`IfcPropertySet`.
- **RDF/OWL** (`tgl/ifc5/toRdf.ts`): emit triples against **BOT (Building Topology
  Ontology)** + **PROPS/OPM** for properties:
  `bot:Zone`/`bot:Space`, `bot:adjacentZone`, `bot:Element`, `bot:hasElement`,
  `bot:interfaceOf` (doors). Each node's `guid` is the URI fragment, so IFC5 GUID
  ↔ RDF URI are the same stable identifier (no remapping). Linked‑data‑ready:
  external twins (energy, cost) reference our URIs directly.

**Lossless guarantee:** because our graph already carries typed nodes/edges +
psets + stable GUIDs, both exporters are **structure‑preserving projections** — no
information is invented or dropped.

## §6 — Determinism risks & protections

| Risk | Protection |
|---|---|
| **GUID/ID generation** | Deterministic `ifcGuid(seed, role, index, geomKey)` via FNV‑1a; the `seed` is derived from the shell + program (stable). **Banned:** `crypto.randomUUID`, `Math.random`, `Date.now` in the pipeline. |
| **Map/Set iteration order** | Never iterate a `Map`/`Set` for output; always materialise to arrays sorted by a stable key (id, then x, then z). |
| **Floating‑point drift** | Round to 1e‑6 m at every phase boundary; compare with EPS; never test exact equality on derived floats. |
| **Candidate "search"** | Fixed enumerated strategy set (§2.2) — no RNG, no time budget that changes results. A wall‑clock cap may *truncate* candidates but the kept set is prefix‑stable (strategies in fixed order). |
| **Object key ordering in JSON/RDF** | Emit keys in a fixed declared order so serialisation is byte‑stable. |
| **`squarify` tie‑breaks** | Equal‑ratio ties resolve by input order (already deterministic). |

**Determinism test (global):** `generate(input)` run twice → `deepEqual` on the
full `LayoutGraph` including GUIDs.

---

## §7 — Unit‑test contract per phase (invariants)

- **P1 `rectDecomposition`** — Σ rect area ≤ polygon bbox; for rectilinear input Σ area == polygon area; no rect center lies outside the polygon; rects pairwise non‑overlapping; rectangle→1, L→≥2. *(✅)*
- **P2 `bubbleGraph`** — every room area ≥ §8 minimum; Σ targets ≥ availableArea (pre‑clamp ≈); every private room has a path to `entryId` in the edge set; open‑plan kitchen↔dining edge `via:'open'`. *(✅)*
- **P3a `squarify`** — cells tile bounds (Σ area == bounds area ± EPS); pairwise non‑overlap; in‑bounds; area proportions preserved; aspect ratio bounded for even splits. *(✅)*
- **P3b `subdivide`** — every room gets exactly one footprint; footprints ⊆ shell rects; non‑overlapping; total footprint area ≈ shell area; corridor cell present iff `corridorId`.
- **P4 `wallsAndDoors`** — each interior wall references ≤2 spaces; each `via:'door'` bubble edge realised by exactly one opening on the shared wall; door fits (offset+width ≤ wall length, clearance ≥ 0.6 m); no duplicate wall for a shared boundary.
- **P5 `semanticGraph`** — graph connected via `CONNECTS_THROUGH`+`ADJACENT_TO` from `entry`; every Space has ≥1 `BOUNDS` wall; every Door has `FILLS`→Opening→`HOSTED_BY`→Wall (C15 chain intact); GUIDs unique + deterministic across two runs.
- **P6 `spaceSyntax`** — depths finite + monotone from entry; MD/RA match hand‑computed values on a fixture; disconnected graph → flagged (not NaN).
- **P7 `score`** — each axis ∈ [0,1]; a known‑good layout outscores a known‑bad one on the targeted axis (e.g. bedrooms‑deep beats bedrooms‑shallow on `circulation`).
- **P8 `enumerate`** — returns ≤ count options; options Pareto‑sorted (no option dominates an earlier one); **deterministic** (two runs deep‑equal); < 2 s for a 12‑room program.
- **P9 `emitGeometry`** — every Space/Wall/Door in the graph appears in the `LayoutOption`; mm conversion exact (×1000); door `elementId` == door GUID (C15).
- **P10 `ifc5/rdf`** — round‑trip node/edge counts preserved; every GUID present in both exports; RDF validates against BOT shapes.

## §8 — Build order & consumer wiring

P3b → P4 → P5 → P6 → P7 → P8 → P9, each pure + tested + committed. P8's
`ScoredLayoutOption[]` replaces `generateProceduralLayout` behind the existing
opt‑in `proceduralFallback` seam in `generate.ts`; P9 feeds the existing
`buildLayoutCommands` → the editor build pipeline is unchanged. The `LayoutGraph`
(P5) is exposed for the future digital‑twin + IFC5 work (P10) — that is the
BIM3.0 payload, persisted independent of the geometry.
