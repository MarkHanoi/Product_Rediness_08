# PRYZM — Master Architecture, Capabilities & Track File

## §0 — North Star (one sentence)

> **PRYZM is the design intelligence platform for the built environment** — the first tool where a single conversation can take a project from raw site to coordinated building model, with every spatial, environmental, and regulatory constraint baked in from the first prompt.

PRYZM 3 is a **browser-native, layered, plugin-extensible BIM/AEC editor** that competes with Revit/Archicad on capability, Bonsai/IFC.js on openness, Forma/Qonic/Motif on collaborative speed. **Single white UI**, **single composition root** (`composeRuntime()`), **single open file format** (`.pryzm` ↔ IFC4 round-trip).

## §1 — The 5 platform principles (product vision §3)

| Principle | Practice |
|---|---|
| Conversation-first authoring | Every workflow begins with NL prompt. RAC drives project initiation. Batch AI commands drive generation. |
| Site-grounded design | Geolocation drives orientation, sun, wind, shadows BEFORE any geometry. |
| Constraint-aware generation | 248+ architectural/regulatory/spatial constraints. ROOM_RULES is the law. Layouts valid by construction. |
| Living BIM model | Stores intent + constraints + relationships + performance targets ALONGSIDE geometry. Changing a target adapts the layout. |
| Human + AI collaboration | AI generates, humans review/refine. Manual + batch AI + conversational coexist. Human always in control. |

## §2 — The 8 architectural principles (P1–P8, CI-enforced)

| # | Principle | Gate today |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | Single composition root (`composeRuntime()`) | Soft-fail counter; hard at Phase D exit |
| P2 | Single THREE owner (`packages/renderer-three/`) | Hard-fail (ESLint boundaries) |
| P3 | Single rAF (`packages/runtime-composer/src/scheduler.ts`) | Soft-fail tripwire; hard at Wave 7 |
| P4 | No `(window as any)` outside `src/legacy/window-shim.ts` | Soft-fail counter; hard at Phase E exit |
| P5 | Schemas are pure (no I/O / THREE / DOM in `packages/schemas/`) | Hard-fail |
| P6 | Commands are the only mutation path (no direct store writes from UI) | Hard-fail |
| P7 | Visibility intent ≠ UI state (`packages/visibility/` is a domain concept) | Hard-fail |
| P8 | Sync conflicts explicit + every public function ≥ 1 OpenTelemetry span | Hard-fail per-PR |

## §3 — The 13 differentiators (D1–D13)

| # | Differentiator | Status |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Open `.pryzm` file format (IFC4 lossless round-trip) | Live |
| D2 | Run-anywhere browser-native | Live |
| D3 | Real-time multi-user with explicit conflicts (CRDT) | Live (LWW today; Yjs full CRDT in Phase 2D) |
| D4 | Plugin SDK with marketplace (`@pryzm/sdk` v1.0.0) | Live; npm-publish + DNS pending |
| D5 | AI as first-class layer | Live (ai-host + 45+ workflows) |
| D6 | Sovereignty default (EU region + BYOK) | Architecture defined; deployment pending |
| D7 | Self-host minimum (5-user team in < 1 day on their own AWS) | Live (`pryzm-selfhost/`) |
| D8 | Federated clash detection (BCF round-trip with Solibri/Navisworks/BIMcollab) | Live (`plugins/bcf/`) |
| D9 | Pascal-editor-grade family creation | In progress (`apps/component-editor/`, Family Platform P0 pending) |
| D10 | Honest performance contracts (17 NFTs measured in CI every sprint) | 17/17 bench files live |
| **D11** | **Architecturally sound Sheet & PDF export** | **α-substrate shipped (C24+C29)** |
| **D12** | **Native Revit round-trip via IFC4** | **α-substrate shipped (C26)** |
| **D13** | **BIM 3.0 Inspect & Data Model** | **α-substrate shipped (C27+C28)** |

## §4 — The 9-layer model

```
L9.5  src/ (2 folders: engine/, ui/) — transitional, shrinking → src/ui/ only
L9    plugins/* (47)           ← may only import L8 (plugin-sdk)
L8    packages/plugin-sdk      ← public SDK facade (v1.0.0)
L7    packages/ui-base, src/ui ← UI hosts bound to runtime
L6    packages/runtime-composer ← THE composition root (composeRuntime)
L5    apps/* (13) + packages/file-format + view-state
L4    packages/renderer, render-runtime, render-pipeline, persistence-client, scene-committer
L3    packages/stores, runtime-composer consumers (frame-scheduler, sync-client, input-host, physics-host, ui, view-state, data-engine, headless, crash-reporter, family-* runtime)
L2    packages/geometry-* (13 element types) + ai-host + constraint-solver + drawing-primitives + geometry-kernel + spatial-index + room-topology + family-instance/loader/runtime + types-builtin
L1    packages/command-bus, picking, visibility, snapping, ai-cost, sync-client, runtime-undo-stack, renderer-three (single THREE), event-bus, formula-library, geospatial, storage-driver, stores (base), feature-flags
L1½   packages/protocol, drawing-primitives (L0-consumers)
L0    packages/schemas (Zod foundation)
```

A higher layer may import a lower; the reverse is forbidden. CI gate: `eslint-plugin-boundaries`.

### §8.5 — Honest cost rollup

From master plan §5 + per-doc estimates:

- **Apartment plan remaining**: ~225 dev-days (F-tier full obligation ladder) + ~16 wk (cognition L4-L7) + ~20 wk (multi-apartment Tier 16). **~1.5 years single-contributor; ~9 months at two parallel.**
- **C-contracts remaining gap-fill**: ~10-12 wk (refresh of C24-C30 scopes after the autonomous-session work narrows them).
- **Strategic substrates**: GS0 ~19 wk + P0 ~28 wk + BIM 2/3 D-β+D-γ ~10 wk.
- **Manual infra**: 3 OIs (npm publish ×2 + DNS) to close convergence booleans 7/8/9.

## §9 — Anti-duplication doctrine

Critical for this session: I added Psets/Qto to the EXISTING `IFC4X3Exporter.ts` — I did NOT create a parallel pipeline. The same discipline applies to every future track:

1. **`plugins/ifc-export/` IS the IFC export.** Extend its `IFC4X3Exporter.ts`; don't write a parallel exporter.
2. **`plugins/sheets/` IS the sheets system** (S37). The new C24 substrate in `packages/drawing-primitives/src/sheet/` is COMPLEMENTARY — composes with `plugins/sheets/`, doesn't replace it.
3. **`plugins/schedules/` IS the data foundation** (S41). C28 wraps it; new `packages/data-engine/` adds quality rules ON TOP, not parallel.
4. **`packages/ai-host/` IS the AI engine.** Workflows go INSIDE `src/workflows/`; don't fork.
5. **`packages/ifc-inspector/`** + new `apps/editor/src/ui/inspect/` Master Tree — the C27 plan migrates `PropertyInspector.ts` (80 files) INTO the new dashboards. Migration, not replacement.
6. **`composeRuntime()` is the only composition root.** New slots get added to it; no parallel runtime.

Two prior near-misses in this session were caught:
- F4.1 attempted to admit `desk`+`desk_chair` to `FurnitureKind` without closing the 24-row obligation ladder (reverted; documented in `APARTMENT-FURNITURE-AND-ACTIVITY-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN §4.1`).
- Track AA + KK self-used `git stash` (flagged but didn't lose work). Hard rule restated.

## §10 — Where to look first (for newcomers)

Read these in this exact order:

1. `docs/03_PRYZM3/00-PRODUCT-VISION-AND-BUSINESS-STRATEGY-V1.md` — north star, business intent
2. `docs/03_PRYZM3/01-VISION.md` — P1-P8 + D1-D13 + 17 NFTs + 5 customer archetypes
3. `docs/03_PRYZM3/02-ARCHITECTURE.md` — 9-layer model, lint matrix, composition root, convergence booleans
4. `docs/00_Contracts/C00-INDEX.md` — contract suite map + conflict resolution order
5. Specific C-contract relevant to the work
6. **This file** (`MASTER-ARCHITECTURE-AND-CAPABILITIES-2026-06-01.md`) — folder map + capabilities + goals
7. `docs/03_PRYZM3/AUTONOMOUS-SESSION-RUNS-LOG-2026-06-01.md` — recent multi-agent work record
8. `docs/03_PRYZM3/PRYZM3-MASTER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-2026-05-31.md` — synthesis of all C-contracts + apartment plans into one delivery sequence
9. `docs/03_PRYZM3/PRYZM3-PRIOR-ART-AUDIT-2026-05-31.md` — what code already exists vs new work

## §11 — Closing notes

- **94 workspace packages** (78 packages + 47 plugins + 13 apps). Strict L0-L9 layer separation enforced by `eslint-plugin-boundaries`.
- **30 contracts** (C01-C18 RATIFIED + C24-C30 DRAFT). 7 new contracts ratified DRAFT 2026-05-31; should move to REVIEW-READY after the autonomous-session work is reflected.
- **15+ GA gates** (`tools/ga-gate/`); run via `release` package's `run-all.ts`.
- **17 NFT benches** (`apps/bench/src/benches/*.bench.ts`); all live + measured per sprint close.
- **6 user-testable dev modals** under AI Panel → Test (dev): Family Pipeline · Layout Validator · Master Tree (with viewport isolation) · Sheet Generator · Generate PDF · Apartment Data Panel.
- The session's biggest single output: **end-to-end viewport isolation** (C27 INS-α-2 through α-10, ~10 commits, multi-package — visibility/IsolationIntent + stores/IsolationStateStore + renderer-three/IsolationAnimator + apps/editor/ui/inspect substrate). Demonstrable from the Test Master Tree modal.
