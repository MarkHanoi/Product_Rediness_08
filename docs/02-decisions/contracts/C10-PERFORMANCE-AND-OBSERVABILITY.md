## §1 — The 19 Non-Functional Targets (NFTs)

These are **measured contracts**, not aspirational goals. Each runs as a benchmark in `apps/bench/src/benches/*.bench.ts`. The bench suite MUST run in CI on every merge to main. A regression on any NFT is a **merge blocker** on the PR that caused it.

NFTs 1–17 exist as of Wave 13 (2026-05-01) ✅. NFT 18 added Wave A16 (2026-05-03) ✅. NFT 19 target Wave A18.

| 19 | E2E suite (Playwright, 10 critical flows) | all green on every CI run | `e2e-playwright-suite.spec.ts` (Wave A18 ✅) |

### §1.1 — Measurement methodology

- Benchmarks run in a headless Chromium instance via `@vitest/browser`.
- All p95 targets are measured over ≥ 100 samples.
- The bench suite runs after `pnpm build` to measure production bundle performance, not dev server performance.
- NFT regressions are tracked in `03-CURRENT-STATE.md §1` alongside the code metrics.

## §2 — OpenTelemetry Span Contract (P8)

**Every new exported function MUST add ≥ 1 OpenTelemetry span.** This is a merge blocker.

### §2.1 — Span naming convention

```ts
const span = tracer.startSpan('pryzm.<package>.<operation>');
// Examples:
//   pryzm.geometry-kernel.section-cut
//   pryzm.persistence-client.save-project
//   pryzm.ai-host.plan-critique
```

### §2.2 — Required span attributes

| Attribute | Type | Required for |
|---|---|---|
| `pryzm.project_id` | string | All project-scoped operations |
| `pryzm.user_id` | string | All user-triggered operations |
| `pryzm.element_count` | number | Geometry and scene operations |
| `pryzm.command_type` | string | Command handler spans |
| `error` | boolean | All spans (set true on exception) |

### §2.3 — CI gate

`scripts/ci-check-spans.ts` runs on every PR. It diffs the changed files for new `export` declarations and checks that at least one `tracer.startSpan` call exists in the same function scope.

### §2.4 — User-facing observability events (toasts + polls)

OTel spans are the operator-facing channel. The **user-facing** observability channel is the in-app toast/event pipeline:

- **§VALIDATE-CACHE.** Workflows that produce per-room warnings (the §F-Sprint-5 furnish circulation gate, see C09 §3.4.1) MUST emit them on a `*.layout-executed` event payload AND cache them in-memory so the user can review via a `pryzm…Warnings()` console command after the toast scrolls off.
- **§VALIDATE-TOAST.** When a `*.layout-executed` event carries `validationWarnings.length > 0`, the trigger MUST emit a single `pryzm:toast` of severity `info` (not `error` — the gate flags risk, not failure) pointing the user at the review command. Severity is `info` because the layout still landed.
- **§BUILD-TOAST.** Generative completion toasts MUST surface dropped-element counts when the §PREVIEW-VS-BUILD gate rejected items during the build runBatch — e.g. `Built layout — N walls, M doors (K dropped — see console)`. Severity stays `success`; the drops are advisory. The drops MUST also be logged through a `console.group(§BUILD-WARN — N item(s) dropped during build)`.

### §2.5 — Polling / wait telemetry (§POLL-TELEMETRY)

Silent post-runBatch polls (wait-until-store-mutation, wait-until-room-named, etc.) MUST emit a structured `<stage>.<poll>-completed` event on `runtime.events` (P4) with:

- `levelId`
- `durationMs` (Date.now()-start)
- `attempts` (poll iteration count)
- `pollDescription` (what was being waited on)

This converts the otherwise-invisible silent latency into an observable metric so an operator can answer "why did the apartment build take 8 s instead of 2 s?" without console-archaeology. The two reference sites today are `apartment.wall-poll-completed` + `apartment.room-name-completed` (`e0a4b44`).

## §3 — Bundle Splitting Strategy

The editor app MUST apply manual chunk splitting to prevent the heavy vendor bundles from blocking the initial load. Current split boundaries (enforced in `vite.config.ts`):

| Chunk | Packages | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `vendor-cesium` | `cesium` | Geospatial viewport open |
| `vendor-web-ifc` | `web-ifc` | IFC import dialog |
| `vendor-thatopen` | `@thatopen/*` | IFC viewer open |
| `vendor-pathtracer` | `three-gpu-pathtracer` | Photorealistic render mode |
| `vendor-three-bvh` | `three-mesh-bvh` | Loaded with three core |
| `vendor-three` | `three` | Always loaded (deferred) |
| `vendor-pdfjs` | `pdfjs-dist` | PDF viewer |
| `vendor-dxf` | `dxf` | DXF import |
| `vendor-rhino3dm` | `rhino3dm` | Rhino import |
| `vendor-chart` | `chart.js` | Data Workbench / schedules |

**Rationale**: jspdf, svg2pdf, and html2canvas MUST NOT be manually chunked — doing so causes Vite's `__vitePreload` runtime to be co-located with the jspdf vendor chunk, pulling 477 KB of export code into the eager startup graph (documented incident, Contract 18 audit).

The `chunkSizeWarningLimit` is set to 1500 KB to suppress false-positive warnings for the intentionally large CAD/BIM vendor chunks.

## §4 — CI Gate Inventory (Performance + Build)

| Gate | Condition | Failure mode |
|---|---|---|
| All 17 NFT benches pass | No regression from baseline | Merge blocker |
| `pnpm build` succeeds | `npm run build` exits 0 | Merge blocker |
| Bundle size < 4 MB gzipped | NFT 15 | Merge blocker |
| TypeScript `--noEmit` 0 errors | `pnpm tsc --noEmit` | Merge blocker |
| All workspace tests pass | `pnpm test:ci` | Merge blocker |
| OpenTelemetry span coverage | `scripts/ci-check-spans.ts` | Merge blocker (P8) |

---

## §5 — Crash Reporter

`packages/crash-reporter/` captures unhandled errors and unhandled promise rejections in production. It MUST:
- Sanitise any PII (user IDs are hashed; no project content is sent).
- Not block the main thread.
- Be configurable off via `CRASH_REPORTER_DISABLED=true` for self-hosted deployments.

---

## §6 — Disaster Recovery

The DR runbook is in `docs/04-reference/runbooks/DR-DRILL-RUNBOOK.md`. The runbook MUST be exercised (dry-run drill) at least once per quarter. Key RTO/RPO targets:

| Target | Value |
|---|---|
| Recovery Time Objective (RTO) | < 4 hours |
| Recovery Point Objective (RPO) | < 1 hour (Supabase WAL-based point-in-time recovery) |
| DR drill cadence | Quarterly |

The last DR drill MUST be logged in `03-CURRENT-STATE.md §11` with its date and outcome.
