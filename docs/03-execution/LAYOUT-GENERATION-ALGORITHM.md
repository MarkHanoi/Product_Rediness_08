# LAYOUT-GENERATION-ALGORITHM.md

**Status:** living reference · **Author:** Claude (PRYZM agent) · **Date:** 2026-06-13
**Scope:** the end-to-end automatic floor-plan generator (apartment + house), the D-TGL
engine, the editor execution/realisation path, the known defects with their root causes,
and the recommended fix roadmap. Written as the capstone of a long debugging session so the
analysis is not lost and a browser-capable continuation can pick it up precisely.

> **Why this doc exists.** Across many test rounds the founder reported recurring defects
> (upper-floor white space, rooms merging, windows between rooms, open corners, doors in the
> wrong room, beds through walls). Several were root-caused to *one* structural cause (the
> stair carve) and to a *systematic engine→execution gap*. This document captures the full
> pipeline, the precise root causes, every fix attempted (and why some had to be reverted),
> and what the correct fix is. **The single most important finding:** unit tests pass on the
> *engine output* but do not exercise the *editor's render of that output*, so a green test
> suite does NOT prove a correct rendered plan.

## 0. The two entry points

| Command / surface | Path | Stair? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pryzmGenerateApartmentLayout()` / apartment modal | single storey, no vertical core | **No** | One plate, one rect — fills cleanly. The "good" baseline. |
| `pryzmGenerateHouse(n)` / "Design your house" modal | multi-storey, vertical stair core | **Yes** | The stair carve fractures the plate — source of most house-only defects. |

Both share the **D-TGL engine** (`packages/ai-host/src/workflows/apartmentLayout/tgl/`). The
house adds an **orchestrator** (`packages/ai-host/src/workflows/houseLayout/`) that splits the
programme across storeys and reserves the stair core, then calls the same engine per storey.

## 2. THE central defect — upper-floor / secondary white space (root-caused)

**Symptom:** a generated house leaves a large unassigned cell (e.g. `Room 01-001 40 m²`) — on
the upper floor, and on the ground too when over-programmed. **The apartment never does this.**

**Root cause (definitive):**
- Apartment: no stair → no carve → the plate is **one rect** → squarify tiles it fully → **0 residual**.
- House: the stair is carved in a corner → the plate is an **L** that decomposes into a
  **dominant rect + a secondary rect** (`§DIAG-RECTS areas=[99.4, 36.2, 6.8]`). When the
  dominant clears the 0.40 gate, `trySingleRectCarve(dominant)` packs the **whole programme into
  the dominant rect only** and ships (0 drops). The **secondary rect is left empty**. Because it
  sits *across the stair* from every placed room, the residual-fill cannot GROW any room into it
  (nothing abuts it; bordering rooms are at their hard-max) → it MINTS a cluster of ~7 m² `Store`
  cells. The editor then renders that cluster as one generic `Room NN-NNN`.
- Over-programming (e.g. 3→5 beds on ~95 m²) pushes all beds upstairs, the ground bedroom
  disappears, and BOTH plates get an unfilled secondary rect.

**The hard tension (why it is not a one-liner):** the **carve path is exactly what guarantees the
stair↔corridor connection** (via `orientCorridorToKeepOut` in `finalise`). Any path-swap that
fills the secondary rect (`packMultiRect`, `tryStairSpanningCorridor`) **breaks stair circulation**
— PROVEN: re-routing the carve decision failed **15 `stairUpperCirculationFace` + 8
`stairDensePlateIntegrity`** tests. White-space-fill and stair-connection are in *direct conflict*
in the current carve architecture.

**Fix attempts (all reverted — recorded so they are not repeated):**
1. Grow per-room TARGET areas in `scaleProgramToShell` → **ineffective**: the subdivider fills by
   COUNT + squarify geometry, not target size; the residual rect did not move.
2. Carve-decision swap to the smallest-residual path (loose 8 m²/8 % gate) → **25 test regressions**.
3. Same with a tight 15 m²/12 % gate → still **23 stair-circulation regressions** (the tension above).
4. Residual-fill grow / mint-fewer → **blocked**: nothing abuts the secondary rect across the
   stair; `utility` mint is capped at ~7.5 m² (`RESIDUAL_MINT_MAX_M2`).

**The correct fix (needs implementation + VISUAL validation):** make the **carve itself span the
L** — place/relocate one room into the secondary leg AND keep the corridor running to the stair
(what an architect does with an L-plan). Concretely: extend `tryStairSpanningCorridor` to relocate
a *private* room (a bedroom, for bedroom-only upper floors — today it only relocates *public*
rooms), fire it when the dominant carve leaves a large residual (not only on a drop), and prove the
stair still doors onto circulation. This will change the ~25 layout-pinning house tests, which must
be **re-baselined deliberately and confirmed-better by eye** — it cannot be validated by unit tests
alone, and the agent that wrote this doc has **no browser** to see the rendered result.

---

## 3. THE systematic engine→execution realisation gap

**Symptom (founder, on the confirmed-current build `cb76fa91`):** exterior wall corners open,
windows mis-placed, doors in the wrong room/protruding, new bed variants set up wrong, Living +
Bedroom **merged into one room** — even though each of these has a code fix that **passes its unit
tests** (corners v191, windows v194, doors v183, beds v195).

**Conclusion:** the engine produces *correct data* (tests pass on it) but the **editor's build of
that data diverges**. Established instance: v194 — the modal confined each window to its room band
correctly, but the build path re-clamped the window to the *whole* shell wall ignoring the
partition junctions, dragging it across into the neighbour. The "Living+Bedroom merge" is the same
class: a divider wall is in the engine output but does not close the detection loop in the build
(dropped by `repairSegments`' 0.50 m floor, or its endpoints weld outside the 20 mm room-detection
grid after the world-rotation), so `RoomDetectionEngine` reads one space and `nameDetectedRooms`
labels it generically.

**Why it kept looking unfixed:** the gate this agent can run — `tsc --skipLibCheck` (0) +
`pnpm --filter @pryzm/ai-host test` (2650) — **does not exercise the editor render**. A green
suite is necessary but NOT sufficient. The authoritative signal lives in the browser console:
the `§DIAG-EXEC-*` block (fires after the build; filter the console by `§DIAG` to surface it).

---

## 4. Diagnostic instrumentation map (how to localise any future defect in ONE console paste)

Filter the browser console by `§DIAG` after a generate. Key lines, by symptom:

| Symptom | Line | Reads |
|---|---|---|
| white space / generic cell | `§DIAG-RECTS`, `§DIAG-FILL-RESIDUAL` | dominant/secondary rects; grown vs minted; largestBlankAfter |
| rooms merged | `§DIAG-EXEC-ROOMS` | engineRooms=N vs detectedRooms=M + both lists (M<N ⇒ merge) |
| divider wall missing | `§DIAG-EXEC-WALLS` | shell vs partition wall counts built |
| corners open | `§DIAG-PERIM-CORNER-WHOLE` | per-corner GAP in mm (>120 mm ⇒ outside v191's §NEAR-CORNER-L) |
| openings not cut | `§DIAG-OPENING-VOID` | per wall: voidCut yes/no + why (instanced / hidden / cached-invalid join) |
| window between rooms | `§DIAG-WIN`, `§WINDOW-SPAN-FIT` | per room: wall, roomBand, placed offset; drops |
| window out of shell | `§DIAG-EXEC-WIN-BOUNDS` | windows past the wall span |
| oversized stair | `§DIAG-STAIR-FOOTPRINT-RATIO`, `§DIAG-EXEC-STAIR-SIZE` | cellToFootprint× (>1.6 ⇒ oversized) |
| stair sealed / served-through | `§DIAG-STAIR-CIRC`, `§DIAG-EXEC-ADJ` | sharesCorridorWall, doorOntoCirculation |
| over-program / dropped rooms | `§FEASIBILITY-ALLOC`, `§DIAG-TOPO-GATE`, `§DIAG-WINNER` | fillRatio>1 ⇒ over-program; failed=[circulation,reach] |
| entrance door wrong room | `§DIAG-EXEC-ENTRANCE`, `§DIAG-ENTRANCE-FIX` | mainDoor on the hall's shell wall? |
| summary | `§DIAG-EXEC-ROLLUP` | roomsWithDoor / windowless / overCap / noEngineMatch / winOutOfBounds |

`logExecRoomDiagnostics` is wired from `nameDetectedRooms.ts:208` and fires on every house +
apartment generate, in the build `cb76fa91`+.

---

## 5. Fix roadmap (prioritised, with the validation each needs)

1. **Engine→execution realisation gap (HIGHEST LEVERAGE).** Fixing it makes the *already-shipped*
   corner/window/door/bed fixes actually render. Drive it from `§DIAG-EXEC-ROOMS`/`-WALLS`/
   `§DIAG-OPENING-VOID`/`§DIAG-PERIM-CORNER-WHOLE`. Likely first target: the divider-wall that
   doesn't close the detection loop (the Living+Bedroom merge) — check `repairSegments` 0.50 m
   drop + post-rotation junction weld vs the 20 mm detection grid.
2. **White-space L-spanning carve** (§2). Deep geometry; re-baseline ~25 house tests; validate by eye.
3. **Stair size** for the corner disposition if `cellToFootprint > 1.6` persists.
4. **Door clash / entrance-door room** refinements (§DIAG-EXEC-ENTRANCE / -DOORS driven).

**Process rule learned the hard way:** for anything in the subdivision/carve core, write the
failing test first, change ONE lever, run the FULL `ai-host` suite, and treat any
`stairUpperCirculationFace` / `stairDensePlateIntegrity` / `houseProgramSizerConvergence`
failure as a real regression (those pin the stair-circulation guarantee). Do not ship a layout
change that flips the subdivision path selection without re-baselining + visual confirmation.
