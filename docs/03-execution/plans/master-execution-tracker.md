# PRYZM — Master Execution Tracker

> **Stamp**: 2026-06-03 · **Status**: CANONICAL · **The day-to-day navigation tracker**
> **Latest (2026-06-03)**: IP-A5.X apex/app split is CODE-COMPLETE on `main` (every remaining item is user infra: Fly deploy · DNS · Supabase Pro). IP-A3 RAC pipeline at ~90% — apex→app deep-link wired (A.17.x.23), post-auth brief-ready seam (A.5.g), apartment-from-footprint console cmd + AI-panel button (A.5.g.2). The full RAC→GIS→scene→apartment-from-boundary journey is now sequenced in [PIPELINE-RAC-TO-SITE-TO-DESIGN-2026-06-03.md](./PIPELINE-RAC-TO-SITE-TO-DESIGN-2026-06-03.md); C19 `SiteModelStore`+`ParcelBoundarySchema` confirmed REAL. Next headless slice: site L5 dispatch adapter (A.7.c.x) → A.5.g.3 read-boundary → generate.
> **Purpose**: ONE table answering "what's the next thing to do?" — every active sub-phase across Phases A/B/C with goal, description+refs, status.
> **Companion to**: the layered plans ([cadence-and-planning-system.md](./cadence-and-planning-system.md) explains the planning system; this doc is the operational view across all horizons).
> **Update cadence**: at every sprint close + on any major status change. PR + review.

## §2.5 — CONSOLIDATED PHASE-BY-PHASE INDEX (the single canonical view)

The audits in §12, §16, §18, §19, §20 surfaced ~584 sub-phases across Phases A/B/C/D + cross-cutting X.*. This §2.5 indexes the canonical tables — §3 (Phase A), §4 (Phase B), §5 (Phase C), §6 (Phase D), §7 (X cross-cutting) — and points to the sub-section for each category.

Every sub-phase **anywhere in this doc** has the `| Phase | Goal | Description + references | Status |` row format. The aggregated counts per category:

### §2.5.1 — How to use this index

For day-to-day operations:

- **Standup**: open §3 (Phase A) — scan for 🟢 IN PROGRESS + 🟡 NEXT UP rows
- **Sprint planning**: cross-reference §3 against the quarterly plan (Q3 / Q4)
- **Phase exit**: re-read §3 + verify all rows → ✅ DONE or 🔵 DEFERRED with ADR
- **Cross-team handoff**: cite the sub-phase ID + the doc reference in the row
- **New work surfaces**: pick a phase + category from §2.5 + add a row in the right §3.x / §4.x / §5.x / §6.x sub-section per the convention in §15

**The canonical detailed tables follow in §3 (Phase A), §4 (Phase B), §5 (Phase C), §6 (Phase D), §7 (X cross-cutting).** All sub-phase rows from §12–§20 audit sections are referenced through §2.5 to their source rows — the audit sections preserve the authoring trail without duplicating the table content.

## §2.6 — UI Testing Inflection Points (IPs) — the user-testable moments

A development plan without testable inflection points is theoretical. **Every sprint of Phase A ships a concrete UI surface the user (founder · architect-on-team · pilot customer) can click through to verify the work is real**. Each IP = one demo + one acceptance test + one customer feedback loop.

The IP framework injects testing cadence into the otherwise-infrastructure-heavy Phase A. Sub-phases group around IPs — at every IP, the user opens the app and validates the cumulative surface.

### §2.6.1 — IP design principles

| Principle | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Every 2 weeks** | Sprint close = IP close. No 4-week gaps without UI surface. |
| **Cumulative, not destructive** | Each IP builds ON the previous (regression-tested). A new IP never breaks the previous IP's testable workflow. |
| **One sentence acceptance** | The IP can be summarised in one sentence: "User can do X." If you need 3 sentences, split into 2 IPs. |
| **Demo-able in < 10 min** | The full IP demo (signup → action → result) runs in under 10 minutes; longer demos hide UX friction. |
| **Pilot-customer-runnable** | A pilot customer can run the IP demo with a 1-page script + zero engineering help. |
| **Inflection ≠ feature complete** | An IP is the user-visible moment; the work behind it may still have polish or edge-cases that close in later IPs. |

### §2.6.2 — IP status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🎯 **OPEN** | Currently being built toward |
| ✅ **REACHED** | Demonstrated; user-tested; acceptance criteria met |
| ⚠️ **PARTIAL** | Demonstrated but with acceptance gaps |
| 🔁 **REGRESSING** | Was REACHED; broke in a later sprint; recovering |

## §3.0 — Phase A — Inflection Point Roadmap (13 IPs across 6 months)

Every 2-week sprint of Phase A delivers a testable UI moment. The columns answer: **WHEN** (sprint close), **WHAT'S TESTABLE** (one-sentence user-can statement), **CONTRIBUTING SUB-PHASES** (the work powering this IP), **DEMO SCRIPT REFERENCE** (where the test runbook lives), **SUCCESS CRITERIA** (specific pass conditions).

> **2026-06-02 re-rank**: the original calendar-order (IP-A1 → IP-A13) assumed each IP would close in its sprint slot. By Sprint 2 we have ~ 40 % of sub-slices DONE across 9 IPs but **0 IPs closed** — substrate landed everywhere, surface landed nowhere. The new **`🎯 Closure rank`** column re-orders IPs by engineering-closability so we drive ONE IP to acceptance at a time. Original IP numbers (`IP-A1` … `IP-A13`) are preserved because external docs reference them; the new sequencing is the rank column. External infra blockers (npm token, Cloudflare DNS, paying customers) are flagged inline so the user can unblock in parallel. **Closure rank 1 — old IP-A5** (pricing + provenance + brand cutover) — is the active focus because pricing ships + provenance backend ships + DNS unblock is in flight (user has `pryzm.so` in Cloudflare).

| Closure rank | IP # | Sprint close | Theme | What the user can test (one sentence) | Contributing sub-phases | Success criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **🔁 0 — REGRESSING / REPLATFORM** | **IP-A5** | Sprint 5 · 2026-09-08 | **Brand cutover + C19/C21 canonical (under replatform)** | "I navigate to pryzm.so, see the editor's landing → sign-in → project hub → main canvas as ONE app, hosted on Cloudflare + Supabase." | 🔁 A.17 (Cloudflare Pages was live for Astro mirror; **retired per ADR-055** — pryzm.so flips to Fly.io editor in Phase A, then to Cloudflare Pages + Functions in Phase B+), ✅ A.M.3 (manifesto.astro — superseded; **content moves into editor route** per ADR-055 §7), ✅ A.M.4 (trust.astro — same), ✅ A.18 (pricing-page generator — **deleted per ADR-055 §7**, editor renders directly from @pryzm/entitlements), ✅ A.M.5 (root index.astro — **deleted per ADR-055 §7**, editor's LandingPage.ts is canonical), ✅ A.31.e (L5 Provenance panel + right-click menu — 48 tests — UNAFFECTED by replatform), ⚪ C19 + C21 ratifications (deferred) | (1) pryzm.so resolves to the EDITOR (not an Astro mirror) ⚪ in flight via ADR-055 Phase A; (2) Pricing page reads from entitlement registry ✅ (moves into editor); (3) Right-click → "Show AI provenance" ✅ engineering DONE | 🔁 REGRESSING to drive ARCHITECTURE-correct outcome.

## §3.0.3 — Mapping Phase A IPs back to sub-phases (cross-reference)

Every Phase A sub-phase in §3.1–§3.X traces to one or more IPs. This table is the operational pivot:

| Sub-phase | Contributes to IP(s) |
|---|---|
| A.1 TypologyPipeline scaffold | IP-A1 |
| A.2 TypologyManifest schema | IP-A1 |
| A.3 TypologyRegistry + dispatch router | IP-A2 |
| A.4 Apartment refactored as Pack | IP-A2 |
| A.5 RAC chatbot UI | IP-A3 |
| A.5.g.2 Apartment-from-footprint-polygon (✅ console cmd) | IP-A3 |
| A.5.g.3 Apartment-from-boundary ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-03 (`apartmentFromBoundary.ts` · `pryzmGenerateApartmentFromBoundary()` — reads `siteModelStore.getParcelBoundary()` → footprint → `generateApartmentFromScratch`; typology-agnostic site read, §FUTURE-TYPOLOGY flagged; needs in-browser smoke) | IP-A3 · plan: PIPELINE-RAC-TO-SITE-TO-DESIGN-2026-06-03 |
| A.5.g.4 RAC→site-bootstrap router (on pryzm:onboarding-brief-ready → create project + site + route to GIS) | IP-A3 |
| O.1–O.6 Onboarding workflow re-sequence — DESIGN: [ONBOARDING-WORKFLOW-DESIGN-2026-06-03](./ONBOARDING-WORKFLOW-DESIGN-2026-06-03.md). ✅ **O.1 SHIPPED** (auth-first re-order + returning-user branch in `PlatformRouter`). ✅ **O.2 SHIPPED** (`OnboardingStepController` — RAC→location(geocode)→draw-or-skip→generate guided first-run; default-rect skip path = ratified fallback; draw path uses location-only `dispatchSiteLocation` so the drawn boundary is the first `setParcelBoundary`, NOT blocked by the immutable rule; `pryzmToggleGIS` GIS handoff + 60s watchdog. **Browser-verify: the GIS draw handoff timing.**) ✅ **O.5 SHIPPED 2026-06-03** (hub "New Project" → guided RAC→site→generate flow seeded by the modal {name, projectType→typology}; blank-canvas escape kept; `ProjectHub.handleCreate('guided')` → `onStartOnboarding` → `showOnboarding(seed)` `8a11ad0`). ✅ **Onboarding QUALITY PASS 2026-06-03 (founder-tested):** white+purple brand colours + compact panels (was dark/black + oversized — brand violation) `400ce8e`; draw-step modal made **non-blocking** bottom banner so the map is drawable (was a centred overlay covering the map) `6d054b4`; **3D view activated after generate** so the result lands as a building not a flat plan (`window.viewController.activate('3D')`) `80ae89b`. Remaining: O.3 (location as profile-level) · O.4 (profile-persist RAC answers) · O.6 (funnel-top lead line) · **O.7** post-boundary flow redesign (founder spec [[onboarding-site-generate-view-flow]]): ✅ **O.7.1 SHIPPED 2026-06-03** (new `'confirm'` step — after boundary draw/skip, asks "Generate {typology} with AI?" [Generate / Not now] instead of silent auto-gen; keeps the boundary visible via the non-blocking presentation; typology-aware copy threaded from the brief; watchdog + Skip now route to confirm not auto-gen; `OnboardingStepController.renderGenerateConfirmStep` `71d082a`). 🔴 **O.7.2 QUEUED — post-generate view broken (founder-flagged 2026-06-03, twice)**: after "Generate apartment", the LEFT pane (the cream Hektar 2D map the user drew on) goes BLANK and Cesium isn't rendering well — the user is left with no usable site view beside the plan. WANT: keep the cream 2D plan map + the drawn boundary AND show the generated apartment on it, with Cesium-3D as a deliberate on-demand toggle (dual-view). Likely cause: the GIS 2D-map surface is torn down / not re-pointed after the boundary commit + generate, and the post-generate `activate('3D')` leaves the GIS split in a half-state. ✅ **O.7.2 SHIPPED `a3d892f0`** (plan view + 2D/3D toggle after generate). 🔴 **O.7.2.b REFINEMENT QUEUED (founder 2026-06-03)**: the desired flow is — (1) after boundary commit/Enter, **KEEP the cream 2D plan-view map showing the drawn boundary** (do NOT dispose it / jump to the BIM plan — `SiteBoundaryMap2D.commit` disposes the map today); the "Generate with AI?" confirm step appears OVER the 2D map; (2) ONLY on "Generate apartment" swap the view, and it should ALWAYS land on a **fixed dual-pane: LEFT = 3D (default) · RIGHT = plan view**. · 🎨 **O.13 QUEUED — onboarding panels adopt the New Project modal design (founder 2026-06-03, screenshot)**: purple gradient header bar (white title + white × close) + white body + footer button row — matching the hub's "New Project" modal / `authModals`/ProjectHub chrome — instead of the all-frosted-glass look. Keep compact, sizable, movable, slightly transparent. Restyle `onboardingStyles.ts` (rac/os header → purple gradient) + ensure the RAC/step header markup has a close affordance · ✅ **O.13.b SHIPPED 2026-06-04 (`26a872d8`) — PANEL-BACKDROP-UNIFY**: every floating panel/modal scrim now routes through ONE shared token `--pryzm-panel-backdrop: rgba(28,12,60,0.26)` + `--pryzm-panel-backdrop-blur: blur(2px)` (in `apps/editor/src/ui/styles/tokens.ts`; brand purple-tint, NEVER black; sits between the old opaque New-Project ~0.45 and translucent RAC ~0.28 scrims as the founder asked — "between screenshot 1 and 2, more translucent than 1 but more opaque than 2"). 21 scrims repointed across onboarding/projectHub(New Project)/authModals/confirmDialog/apartmentLayoutModal/**BatchLoadingIndicator (the AI batch "Building N elements…" modal — founder: "applies also to batch element creation through the AI command pipeline")**/sheetEditor/drawingHuds/IFC dialogs/etc.; the intentional no-scrim boundary-draw banner (`--drawing`) preserved. · ✅ **O.13.c SHIPPED 2026-06-04 (`4b2daa6`) — brief panel heading unreadable**: in the RAC PROJECT BRIEF panel the body heading ("Tell me about the project — size, bedrooms, style") is CLIPPED under the purple gradient header bar + low-contrast → fix header/body spacing + heading colour so it's fully visible below the header. `onboardingStyles.ts` (`.rac-*` header/body) + the brief-step heading markup. · ✅ **O.13.d SHIPPED 2026-06-04 (`4b2daa6`) — unclear "next step" CTA**: sticky bottom action bar with a prominent purple primary "Generate apartment →"/"Continue →" CTA + de-emphasised ghost Cancel. the advance action ("Mark brief complete") sits at the TOP beside Cancel and isn't an obvious primary CTA → make a prominent PRIMARY purple button (panel bottom) that advances to generate; de-emphasise Cancel; make "what to click to proceed" obvious. · ✅ **O.15 SHIPPED-PARTIAL 2026-06-04 (`4b2daa6`) — kill the project-page flash before the loader**: `PlatformRouter.onBriefReady` now hides `#platform-root` SYNCHRONOUSLY before the async `client.create` chain, so the Project Hub no longer repaints between the brief CTA and the loader (the founder complaint). RESIDUAL (deferred to O.8/O.14): a sub-second pastel-background blank may still show before the loader paints (loader is gated behind one async create hop). ORIGINAL: after the brief CTA the app briefly re-paints the PROJECT HUB/PAGE (~1s) THEN shows the "DOWNLOADING BIM ENGINE…" loader → go DIRECTLY to the loader (skip the intermediate hub paint). The loader's OWN slowness = engine boot, tracked separately at O.8/O.14. · 🟢 **O.8 SHIPPED-PARTIAL 2026-06-04 (`1dd98ff` + prior `3d54541`)** — deferred non-essential engine init past first paint: CRDT/`YjsDocAdapter`/conflict-disclosure UI now lifted into `wireCollaborationCRDT()` behind `requestIdleCallback(4000)`+`setTimeout(1500)` fallback + re-schedule on `pryzm-project-loaded` (safe: CommandBus `_crdtApplier` + BatchCoordinator `_yjsDocAdapter` hooks are null/optional-guarded; nothing on the generate path reads them sync); `_crdtWired` once-guard + `window.__pryzmEnsureCollabCRDT` force-hook + `window.__pryzmEagerBoot` escape flag. Prior commit already deferred initDataPlatform monitoring (DependencyResolver/TemporalGraph/PhysicsEngine/ConstraintEngine/AmbientIntelligence). RESIDUAL: `initScene`/`initBuilders`/`initTools`/`initUI`/persistence MUST stay early (first-paint + generate path). Pairs with O.14 module-warm. ORIGINAL: "Set up your project" takes several seconds to appear because New Project → `createAndOpenProject` runs the FULL BIM engine boot first — `initScene` + `initBuilders` (20 subsystems) + `initTools` + `initDataPlatform` (physics/temporal/semantic graphs) + `initUI` + 34 stores (two main-thread blocks `LONGTASK 1726ms` + `2310ms` in the live log). The OnboardingStepController gates on `pryzm-project-loaded`, which fires only AFTER all of it. But the location/draw steps need NONE of the BIM engine — only the GENERATE step does. **Fix direction:** show the onboarding location step IMMEDIATELY on New Project (decoupled from engine boot), warm the engine in the background, and gate ONLY the generate step on engine-ready; and/or defer non-essential init (physics, data-platform, lifecycle) past first onboarding paint.

DEFERRED (honest): concave-AND-skewed (e.g. L rotated 22°) notches still stair-step; truly arbitrary organic polygons get rotated-frame best-fit (rooms are always rectangles in the rotated frame). ORIGINAL: the generator ALREADY turns the drawn boundary into N shell walls (e.g. 9 for a U-shape), but D-TGL `subdivide` assumes a RECTANGLE → on a non-rectangular (U/L) footprint it drops rooms (`§HARD-MIN-SIDE` spam) and bails to a 1-room rectangle that IGNORES the drawn shape; the layout-picker options are then "completely off" from the plot. **FIX DIRECTION (supersedes the bounding-rectangle rectify): USE THE DRAWN BOUNDARY LINES DIRECTLY as the shell + make D-TGL do a rectilinear DECOMPOSITION of the ACTUAL polygon** (lay rooms inside the real shape, not a bounding rect). Relates to [[single-apartment-fix-pass-spec]] + [[d-tgl-deterministic-layout-engine]]. · 🟡 **AI-HOST-WINDOW-GLOBALS-TYPECHECK (founder-flagged 2026-06-03 — "don't leave them there")**: `pnpm --filter @pryzm/geometry-wall run typecheck` (and other dependent-package typechecks) report TS2339 on `window.commandContext`/`slabStore`/`columnStore`/etc. in `ai-host/src/{AIReadModel,AIElementFactory}.ts`, even though `packages/ai-host/src/global-window.d.ts` declares them all — the ambient `declare global` is a MODULE (`export {}`) so it's NOT loaded when a dependent package transitively compiles ai-host source. ✅ FIX APPLIED 2026-06-03: `/// <reference path="./global-window.d.ts" />` in `AIReadModel.ts` + `AIElementFactory.ts` — ai-host window-global TS2339 GONE (verified). · 🔴 **PER-PACKAGE-TYPECHECK-HYGIENE SWEEP (revealed 2026-06-03, do NOT dismiss)**: running the per-package typecheck exposed the SAME class of pre-existing errors the root/editor typecheck MASKS — `command-registry/src/CommandManagerImpl.ts` TS2339 on undeclared `window.visibilityIntentStore`/`viewIntentInstanceStore`, plus genuine strict-null errors (`Object is possibly undefined`, `string | undefined not assignable`) in `command-registry/{ceilings,curtainwall,ai-vg}/*`. TASK: (1) add the missing window globals to `command-registry/src/global-window-augment.d.ts` + `/// reference` it where read; (2) fix the strict-null sites; (3) add a **CI per-package typecheck gate** so these never accumulate again. LONG-TERM: remove window-global reads per P4 (constructor injection). | IP-A2 · IP-A3 · §7 CI |
| A.6 TypologyPicker UI · **A.6.b** TypologyPickerPanel built (`TypologyPickerPanel.ts`, registry-driven cards) · ✅ **A.6.c SHIPPED 2026-06-05 — House + Apartment selectable end-to-end (full UI)**: the RAC already renders registry-driven typology chips (casa-unifamiliar included) but two blockers hid the house — the New-Project modal's "Residential" auto-seeded `apartment` (skipping the picker) + `briefBootstrap` hard-gated `typologyId !== 'apartment'`. Fixes: modal "Building type" offers explicit **Apartment** + **House — single-family** (PlatformRouter `_typologyForProjectType` maps them; Apartment is the default option); gate widened to `{apartment, casa-unifamiliar}` (both → `generateApartmentFromBoundary`, the casa Pack being a single-storey bridge); RAC chips show the Pack `displayName`; confirm-noun says "house"; style made typology-agnostic (`getActiveDesignMetadata`) so floor + furniture finishes apply to the house. Casa generates as a SINGLE-STOREY house today (A.21.a bridge); multi-storey + stairs = future Pack work. | IP-A3 |

Was: sparse building coverage = OSM source-data gaps (founder-clarified 2026-06-03): the Hektar cream+shadow look is good, but building footprints are missing in many areas — and the founder confirmed it's the SOURCE DATA, not rendering: OpenFreeMap is OSM-derived, so even central Lisbon (Engrácia) has gaps. Any OSM-based vector source (Overpass, other planetiler hosts) shares the SAME gaps. **Only real aerial imagery fills them.** Fix = add a keyless **satellite/aerial basemap toggle** (ESRI World Imagery — the same provider Cesium uses) to the 2D map so the user can switch Hektar-cream ↔ aerial when OSM coverage is thin and still draw the boundary accurately.

## §3 — Phase A — Alpha (Current; 2026-Q3 to 2026-Q4; ~6 months)

**Phase A exit criteria**: see [roadmap-phase-1-alpha.md §1](./roadmap-phase-1-alpha.md). 10 criteria (E1–E10). Closure ADR raised at end of 2026-Q4.

### §3.1 — Phase A capability buckets + sub-phases

| Phase | Goal | Description + references | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A.1** | **TypologyPipeline package scaffold** | NEW `packages/typology-pipeline/` (TypologyRegistry + 7-stage PipelineRouter + 7 stage helpers, 54/54 tests). `composeRuntime()` slot integration deferred to A.3. Refs: [phase-1-alpha §3.1](./roadmap-phase-1-alpha.md), [typology-expansion §4](./typology-expansion-roadmap.md). Owner: Engineer 1. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 1) |
| **A.2** | **TypologyManifest schema** | `packages/schemas/src/typology/manifest.ts` — zod-validated TypologyManifest, 39/39 tests. Refs: [typology-expansion §4.1](./typology-expansion-roadmap.md). | ✅ DONE (Sprint 1) |
| **A.3** | **TypologyRegistry slot + dispatch router** | `runtime.typology = { registry, router }` slot wired in `composeRuntime()` ([types.ts](../../../packages/runtime-composer/src/types.ts), [composeRuntime.ts](../../../packages/runtime-composer/src/composeRuntime.ts)) + 7 integration tests; tearDown clears registry. Pack self-registration deferred to A.4. Refs: [C50 §1.1](../../02-decisions/contracts/C50-TYPOLOGY-PIPELINE.md), [typology-expansion §4.2–4.3](./typology-expansion-roadmap.md). | ✅ DONE (Sprint 1) |
| **A.4** | **Apartment refactored as TypologyPack** | Multi-slice refactor; broken into A.4.a-A.4.x below. Existing `@pryzm/ai-host` apartmentLayout workflow stays intact until A.4.x retires it. Refs: [C50 §6](../../02-decisions/contracts/C50-TYPOLOGY-PIPELINE.md), [phase-1-alpha §3.2](./roadmap-phase-1-alpha.md). | 🟡 IN PROGRESS (Sprint 2) |
| **A.4.a** | **Apartment pack scaffold + bridge registration** | NEW `packages/typology-pack-apartment/` (manifest + bridge generative/bim-emit stages + factory + 16 tests). Registered at boot in `composeRuntime()`. Bridge command `typology.apartment.bridge` to be intercepted by editor's legacyBridge handler (A.4.a-editor-bridge). Refs: [C50 §6](../../02-decisions/contracts/C50-TYPOLOGY-PIPELINE.md). | ✅ DONE (Sprint 1) |
| **A.4.b** | **Move D-TGL into the pack — deterministic Stage 4** | Migrate `packages/ai-host/src/workflows/apartmentLayout/tgl/` + `generate.ts` + `proceduralLayout.ts` into `packages/typology-pack-apartment/src/stages/deterministic.ts`.

| **A.4.x** | **Retire `@pryzm/ai-host` apartmentLayout module** | Remove the legacy path after editor-bridge no longer needed. C50 DRAFT → CANONICAL gate. Refs: [C50 §10 ratification](../../02-decisions/contracts/C50-TYPOLOGY-PIPELINE.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 6) |
| **A.5** | **RAC chatbot UI v1** | Split into A.5.a (L3 pure state-machine — DONE) and A.5.b (L5 React component). Role + typology + brief flow per [product-vision §5 Step 2](../../01-strategy/product-vision.md). Refs: [typology-expansion §2](./typology-expansion-roadmap.md). | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (Sprint 1–3) |
| **A.5.a** | **RAC chatbot L3 state-machine model** | `packages/typology-pipeline/src/RacChatbotModel.ts` — pure 6-phase reducer (intro → awaiting-role → awaiting-typology → awaiting-brief → ready, plus cancelled). Includes `parseRoleFromText` + `parseTypologyIdFromText` deterministic parsers (LLM-fallback path), `toBrief()` exit-shape extractor, `defaultPromptForPhase` UI helper, **`summarizeCapturedState` echo-back helper** (A.5.a.next, 15 tests — single-line architect-readable summary: `OK: architect · apartment · 2-bed · 1-bath · 70m² target · style modern`; canonical key order [bedrooms · bathrooms · targetArea · style · budget · timeline]; unknown keys append alphabetically; integer counts bare, floats 1dp, booleans yes/no, strings trimmed, empty/null/undefined skipped, objects JSON). 48 tests (33 + 15). Reference: `./MasterMiawW/` (the MIAW chatbot — translate patterns into the L5 React component). | ✅ DONE (Sprint 1–2) |
| **A.5.b** | **RAC chatbot L5 React component** | `apps/editor/src/ui/onboarding/RACChatbot.tsx` — wraps A.5.a model with Claude streaming UI (per MIAW ConversationCanvas pattern). Plus the Claude-API call site that does structured extraction for brief fields. | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 3) |
| **A.6** | **TypologyPicker UI** | Split into A.6.a (L3 pure model — DONE) and A.6.b (L5 React component). 10-category card grid. Refs: [typology-expansion §3](./typology-expansion-roadmap.md), [C50 §5.3](../../02-decisions/contracts/C50-TYPOLOGY-PIPELINE.md). | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (Sprint 1–3) |
| **A.6.a** | **TypologyPicker L3 pure model** | `packages/typology-pipeline/src/TypologyPickerModel.ts` — `buildPickerCards(registry, userTier)` + 4 filter helpers + `groupByCategory` + **`groupByPhaseGate`** + **`summarizePickerCards`** (A.6.a.next). Per C50 §5.3 locked cards STAY in the list (annotated with `locked: true` + `lockReason`, never filtered out) so the upgrade-path is visible. Sort: category asc → displayName asc. `groupByPhaseGate` returns groups in stability order (ga → beta → alpha → community-marketplace); empty groups omitted. `summarizePickerCards` returns `{total, available, locked, categoryCount, marketplaceCount, byPhaseGate}` for the L5 header chip. 30 tests (20 + 10). | ✅ DONE (Sprint 1–2) |
| **A.6.b** | **TypologyPicker L5 React component** | `apps/editor/src/ui/onboarding/TypologyPicker.tsx` consumes A.6.a model; renders 10-category card grid + locked badges + category section headers. | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 3) |
| **A.7** | **C19 Site element schemas + SiteStore** | Multi-slice; broken into A.7.a-A.7.f. Refs: [C19](../../02-decisions/contracts/C19-SITE-MODEL-AND-PARCEL.md), [phase-1-alpha §4.1](./roadmap-phase-1-alpha.md). | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (Sprint 1–2) |
| **A.7.a** | **L0 site schemas authored** | 7 schemas in `packages/schemas/src/site/` (SiteModel · Parcel · BuildingFootprint · ContextBuilding · SiteLocation · ProvenanceRecord + branded ids) + 35 tests. Re-uses canonical `Vec3` + `ProjectId` from existing schemas to avoid root-barrel collisions. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 1) |
| **A.7.b** | **SiteStore (L3 reactive store)** | `packages/stores/src/SiteModelStore.ts` (15 tests). Subscribable; resolution helpers (getParcelBoundary · getFootprint · getContextBuildings · getLocation); `set()` + `reset()` + `dispose()` lifecycle. Wired in `composeRuntime()` → `runtime.siteModelStore`. Per [C19 §3.1](../../02-decisions/contracts/C19-SITE-MODEL-AND-PARCEL.md). | ✅ DONE (Sprint 1) |
| **A.7.c** | **`site.*` commands per C16** | Broken into A.7.c.1 (MVS for typology Stage 2 — site.create / site.updateLocation / site.setParcelBoundary, ✅ DONE) and A.7.c.2+ (the rest: updateZoning · setFootprint · context-buildings · replace · delete). Refs: [C19 §4](../../02-decisions/contracts/C19-SITE-MODEL-AND-PARCEL.md), [C16](../../02-decisions/contracts/C16-COMMAND-AUTHORING-PROTOCOL.md). | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (Sprint 1–2) |
| **A.7.c.1** | **MVS: site.create + site.updateLocation + site.setParcelBoundary** | Pure handlers in `packages/stores/src/site-commands/` (17 tests). Enforces §1.1 idempotency · §1.4 parcel polygon immutability · §2.7 edge-classifications length. Domain events `site.created` · `site.location-changed` · `site.parcel-boundary-set` ready for L5 emit. LTP-ENU rebase per §1.3 is the L5 adapter's responsibility. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 1) |
| **A.7.c.2** | **site.updateZoning + site.setFootprint + site.clearFootprint** | 3 handlers in `packages/stores/src/site-commands/` (17 tests). updateZoning patches mutable parcel fields (setbacks · zoning · FAR · maxHeight) without touching the polygon (§1.4); setFootprint runs §1.6 containment + setback check via `@pryzm/site-validators` and SUCCEEDS WITH `warnings` (non-fatal lint per §1.6); clearFootprint sets footprint to null. Domain events `site.zoning-updated` · `site.footprint-set` · `site.footprint-cleared` ready for L5 emit. Refs: [C19 §4.1](../../02-decisions/contracts/C19-SITE-MODEL-AND-PARCEL.md). | ✅ DONE (Sprint 1) |
| **A.7.c.3** | **site.addContextBuilding + site.removeContextBuilding + site.replaceContextBuilding** | 3 handlers in `packages/stores/src/site-commands/` (15 tests). Per §1.5 reference-only neighbour shapes (L0 schema enforces `editable: false` via `z.literal`). addContextBuilding rejects duplicate ids; removeContextBuilding rejects when id missing; replaceContextBuilding is atomic remove + add preserving order, supports same-id or new-id replacement, rejects collision with unrelated entries. Domain events `site.context-building-{added,removed,replaced}` ready for L5 emit. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 1) |
| **A.7.c.4** | **site.resyncContextBuildings (async ingest)** | Per §1.8 — atomic replace from cesium-ion / osm / msft-footprints. | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 3) |
| **A.7.c.5** | **site.linkClimate + site.linkBuilding + site.replace + site.delete** | 4 handlers in `packages/stores/src/site-commands/` (19 tests). `siteLinkClimate` / `siteLinkBuilding` set the C21/C20 cross-element refs (null clears). `siteReplace` = the ONLY path to change parcel polygon per §1.4 — rejects id-mismatch + projectId-mismatch + L0 SiteModelSchema fail; event carries `priorSnapshot` for the single undo entry per §4.4. `siteDelete` rejects WITHOUT explicit `cascadeFromProjectDelete: true` flag per §1.1 (FORBIDDEN in normal flow). Refs: [C19 §4](../../02-decisions/contracts/C19-SITE-MODEL-AND-PARCEL.md). | ✅ DONE (Sprint 1) |

Async, non-blocking, status surfaced in [A.11 climate panel](#). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 4) |
| **A.8.e** | **BuildingFootprint authoring (inside parcel)** | Second polygon tool — draws the project's own building outline on the parcel. Enforces containment + setback compliance per [C19 §1.6](../../02-decisions/contracts/C19-SITE-MODEL-AND-PARCEL.md). Lint warnings surfaced in Site Inspector ([C19 §5.3](../../02-decisions/contracts/C19-SITE-MODEL-AND-PARCEL.md)). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 4) |

Verified at NOAA reference points (June/Dec solstice zenith at tropics, equinox at equator, London white-nights, 80°N polar night). 22 tests. Implemented FRESH (not extracted from RealSunService) so the new package stays L2-pure; a later slice can swap RealSunService internals to call this helper. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 1) |
| **A.10.d** | **L3 ClimateStore + composeRuntime wiring** | `packages/stores/src/ClimateStore.ts` — siteRef → ClimateDataset resolver + cache keyed by ClimateCacheKey (per [C21 §1.4](../../02-decisions/contracts/C21-CLIMATE-INGESTION.md)) so 2 sites within ~1 km share one entry. Stale entries retained in audit archive per §1.5 (never deleted). EPW > NOAA priority applied at ingest (re-ingest supersedes).

The apex/app split (C51) replaces the old "single landing rebuild" approach; the work is tracked under IP-A5.X (A.17.x.*).

Renders per-category comparison tables with the 5 consumer tiers as columns and 30 feature gates as rows. Single source of truth: the L2 registry — no hand-written copy. `pnpm exec astro check` clean.

REMAINING = the EDITOR WIRING follow-up (A.21.d–g: multi-level threading → `AddLevelCommand` fan-out → per-storey command set → `CreateStairCommand` + auto-opening slab-void → slab/roof emission) which needs LIVE in-browser verification, so it is NOT done blind — do it via an agent with a render loop or after a deploy-test cycle. The core's `HouseLayoutResult` is the exact contract the wiring consumes (see A.21.c). **As-built map + the two engine-reuse deviations (stair-core area-budget reduction; per-storey envelope clamp) documented in [SPEC-CASA §13](../specs/SPEC-CASA-UNIFAMILIAR-TYPOLOGY.md#§13--implementation-status--as-built-2026-06-06).** | 🟢 CORE DONE — editor wiring (A.21.d–g) next (Sprint 7–8) |
| **A.21.a** | **Pack scaffold + manifest + brief + register** | NEW `packages/typology-pack-casa-unifamiliar/` mirroring the apartment pack: manifest (`id: casa-unifamiliar`, residential, house roomTypes incl. stair/landing/garage) + slider brief (floors stepper 1–3, bedrooms, garage, garden, master-location) + bridge generative/bim-emit stages + register in `composeRuntime()`. Picker card + RAC recognition go live (both registry-driven). Refs: [SPEC §5,§8](../specs/SPEC-CASA-UNIFAMILIAR-TYPOLOGY.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 7) |
| **A.21.b** | **House program + room types + storey allocation** | ✅ **CORE SHIPPED 2026-06-06** — `houseLayout/storeyAllocation.ts` `allocateProgramToStoreys(program, storeyCount) → StoreyProgram[]` (public/wet/living + kitchen on the GROUND; bedrooms + bathrooms UPSTAIRS; stair+landing reserved on every storey it passes; 1-storey = passthrough; pure + deterministic). `houseLayout/types.ts` adds `StoreyProgram`/`StoreyRole`. NB the `RoomType` enum extension (stair/landing/garage/porch/terrace) + house program-rules `accessFrom` for vertical circulation is the remaining sub-slice (folded into A.21.h validators). Refs: [SPEC §3](../specs/SPEC-CASA-UNIFAMILIAR-TYPOLOGY.md), [SPEC-ARCHITECTURAL-PROGRAM-RULES](../specs/SPEC-ARCHITECTURAL-PROGRAM-RULES.md). | ✅ DONE (core) |
| **A.21.c** | **Storey orchestrator (reuse D-TGL per plate)** | ✅ **SHIPPED 2026-06-06** — NEW `packages/ai-host/src/workflows/houseLayout/` (`houseOrchestrator.ts` `generateHouseLayout(shell, program, constraints, weights, {storeyCount, floorToFloorM=3.0, baseElevationM=0, levelIdForStorey, solar, roofKind='gable'}) → HouseLayoutResult` + `stairCore.ts` `reserveStairCore(footprint, storeyCount)` → an aligned ~1.0 m × 2.6–3.2 m mm rect that STACKS across storeys). Per storey runs the FROZEN single-plate `generateDeterministicLayouts` unchanged: the stair core is handled by shrinking the usable AREA BUDGET (`netAreaM2 = trueArea − stairCoreArea`), not carving the polygon (engine has no obstacle param). Result carries `storeys[]` (levelId/elevationM/footprint), `perStoreyLayout[]`, `stairs[]` (StairCore from/to levelId), `voids[]` (SlabVoid over the stair on every non-ground slab), `roof` (RoofDescriptor, footprint=shell). Pure/deterministic, span-free (spans live at the plane boundary). **36 tests; ai-host 1580/1580 (zero regression).** SECONDARY FIX: the apartment §D3.5 envelope gate rejects a house ground floor (big area, few bedrooms) → orchestrator clamps the engine-area into `apartmentDimensionsFor(bedrooms).{grossMin,grossMax}` per storey (A.21.h should replace with a real house envelope counting non-bedroom area). Refs: [SPEC §6](../specs/SPEC-CASA-UNIFAMILIAR-TYPOLOGY.md). | ✅ DONE |
| **A.21.d** | **Multi-level threading** | `levelId: string` → `storeyPlates: {levelId, elevationM, footprint}[]` through payload / `EnumerateInput` / semanticGraph meta (one Level node per storey) / `LayoutExecuteOptions`; per-storey `levelId` + `baseElevationM` stamping. Refs: [SPEC §6](../specs/SPEC-CASA-UNIFAMILIAR-TYPOLOGY.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 8) |
| **A.21.e** | **Level creation + per-storey command fan-out** | Executor mints L1…Ln via `AddLevelCommand` (L0 Ground exists) at `n × floor-to-floor`; dispatches one level-stamped command set per storey in one runBatch. | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 8) |
| **A.21.f** | **Stair auto-placement + stairwell void** | Programmatic `CreateStairCommand` per adjacent level pair (base/top levelId, shape from core aspect, risers from level-gap), `autoCreateOpening` punches the upper-slab void, writes `connectedByStair` graph edges. Refs: [SPEC §7](../specs/SPEC-CASA-UNIFAMILIAR-TYPOLOGY.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 8) |
| **A.21.g** | **Vertical alignment v1 + slab replication** | Identical exterior shell per storey (walls stack) + `CreateAllSlabsFromLevelToAllFloorsCommand` for floors. Column/beam stacking deferred (P-tier). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 8) |
| **A.21.h** | **House validators + cognition** | **Envelope slice ✅ SHIPPED:** real house envelope `houseLayout/houseEnvelope.ts` `validateHouseStorey` (judges a storey by its FULL programme area, not bedroom count) + injected `envelopeValidator` seam in `generateDeterministicLayouts`/`EnumerateInput` (apartment path byte-identical) retires the per-storey area-clamp kludge (SPEC §13.3 Deviation B resolved); 19 tests, ai-host suite green. Remaining (⚪): stair clearance, cross-floor circulation reachability, wet-stack preference; cognition evaluators + ObjectiveVector axes. | 🟡 IN PROGRESS (Sprint 8–9) |
| **A.21.i** | **Post-gen chain fan-out across storeys** | floor / ceiling / furnish / lighting now run on EVERY house storey, not just the active level. ADDITIVE: new `runHousePostGenChain.ts` orchestrator sets each storey active in turn + drives the existing per-stage triggers (floor + ceiling → furnish → lighting), sequencing on `*.layout-executed` so storeys don't race; `_finishOpenings` returns a Promise so the chain starts after the cross-storey room redetect. `houseFanoutGuard.ts` suppresses the furnish/lighting cascade handlers during the fan-out (prevents double-placement). Apartment single-level path byte-for-byte unchanged (guard false during apartment runs). | 🟢 DONE (Sprint 9) |
| **A.21.D25** | 🏠 **House: furniture/finishes appeared ONLY on the TOP floor — now EVERY storey (ground included)** (founder in-browser test 2026-06-06: a multi-storey house got floors/ceilings/furniture/lights on the top floor only, ground floor bare) | House-only; apartment single-level path byte-for-byte unchanged. **ROOT CAUSE — a NAMING-vs-FURNISH race, not the fan-out loop.** `runHousePostGenChain` already iterated every storey ground-first and set each active before its chain, and every stage executor (floor/ceiling/furnish/light) correctly reads `resolveActiveLevel()` + filters by `level.id`. The bug was upstream: the executor named ALL storeys' rooms in one up-front loop (`nameDetectedRooms` per storey) then waited a FLAT 600 ms before starting the chain. But `nameDetectedRooms` is ASYNC (room-store subscription + 80 ms settle, or its own 2.5 s hard-timeout) and occupancy-tagging is what furnish/floor/ceiling key off (`furnishRoom('')` → [] = "furnish does nothing", A.21.D24). The GROUND storey is processed first, so its furnish fired before its (still-pending) naming completed → 0 furniture on ground; the UPPER storeys, processed later, were named by the time they ran → furnished. Hence "only the top floor." ✅ **FIXED 2026-06-06 (`§A.21.D25`, editor-only).** Moved naming OUT of the up-front loop and INTO the per-storey chain: `runHousePostGenChain` now accepts an optional `nameStorey(levelId)` driver; for EACH storey, in sequence, `runChainForLevel` sets the storey active, calls `nameStorey(levelId)`, and AWAITS that storey's `apartment.room-name-completed {levelId}` event (filtered by levelId; 3.5 s budget > the naming pass's 2.5 s hard-timeout) BEFORE furnishing. So ground rooms are guaranteed tagged before ground furnish — every storey (ground + uppers) gets floors/ceilings/furniture/lights. The executor builds the `nameStorey` from its per-storey `option` map and drops the flat 600 ms wait. Loud per-storey logs already exist (`§POLL-TELEMETRY room-name-completed level=… detected_rooms=N`, `§FURNISH-SUMMARY`, `§FURNISH-EMPTY`) so a genuinely room-less ground storey surfaces its cause. **Tests:** new `apps/editor/__tests__/runHousePostGenChain.test.ts` (4 — every storey furnished ground-first; naming awaited before each storey's furnish; timeout-bounded advance when naming never signals; 3-storey ground-up order). Editor typecheck clean for the 2 changed files (worktree has no node_modules → filtered tsc output to `runHousePostGenChain.ts` + `HouseLayoutExecutor.ts` = zero errors; rest is missing-`@pryzm/*`-dep noise). Determinism preserved; P6 respected (no new mutation path); no new deps. **NEEDS IN-BROWSER VERIFY:** generate a 2-storey house → BOTH floors have floor finishes + ceilings + furniture + lights (not just the top). | 🟢 DONE (in-browser verify pending) |
| **A.21.j** | **Editor onboarding wiring + console** | DONE: both onboarding entry points (`briefBootstrap` + `OnboardingStepController.generateAndFinish`) now route `casa-unifamiliar` → the multi-storey HOUSE generator (`generateHouseFromBoundary`, storeyCount from the brief's `floors` field, default 2, clamped [1,3]) built inside the SAME authored parcel boundary the apartment path reads; apartment path byte-identical; `pryzmGenerateHouse*` console commands already shipped. | 🟢 DONE (UI path routes House correctly) |

Executor build internals UNTOUCHED (only additive `variantIndex`/`variantCount` on `HouseExecuteInput`). Onboarding (`OnboardingStepController.generateHouse → generateHouseFromBoundary`) + console route through the controller. +6 ai-host tests (full suite 1715/1715); house files typecheck-clean. REMAINING: multi-level result view + dollhouse explode. | 🟢 MODAL DONE (result-view/dollhouse pending; in-browser verify) |

#### §3.1.A21D — Casa demo layout-quality fix-pass (DEMO BLOCKERS — generation quality the founder will demo with a house)

These are generation-quality defects the founder hit testing the live casa/apartment generator (the casa demo uses the apartment generator via the A.21.a single-storey stopgap, so these serve BOTH). Root-caused 2026-06-05. Priority order = demo impact. See [single-apartment-fix-pass-spec](../specs/) + [APARTMENT-COGNITION-STACK](../../03_PRYZM3/) (climate-driven design).

> **🚀 DEPLOY STATUS (2026-06-06):** A substantial batch is **staged on `main` and deploy-ready** (1544 ai-host + 0 editor typecheck errors) — D2 non-orthogonal layout (`§RECTIFY-QUAD`), D5.c more-windows, D5.d adjacency (bedroom→corridor), D6.1–D6.3 climate-driven windows, A.25.1/.2 design-parameter sliders + discoverable button, GRAPH.4 click-inspect fix, A.21.D-GLOBE2 context-building mirrors + 7-day cache, room-name nearest-fallback. **BLOCKED on repo visibility, not code:** Fly deploys run free only on the public-repo GitHub-Actions window (16 GB runner; private = limited minutes, Fly remote/Depot builder OOMs at exit 137). The repo is currently **private**, so the next Fly deploy needs the founder to flip it **public** → re-enable the `push:` trigger in `.github/workflows/deploy-fly.yml` → push → poll `flyctl releases --app pryzm` → revert to `workflow_dispatch:`-only → private.

|---|---|---|---|
| **A.21.D1** | ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-06-05** — Windows never created (`shell windows built — 0/0`) | Root cause: `shellWallMatch.matchShellHost` required EXACT (1 cm) endpoint match, so the D-TGL's axis-aligned perimeter never matched a non-orthogonal drawn shell → windows dropped. FIX (`§SHELL-MATCH-TOLERANT`): after the exact pass, fall back to the nearest near-PARALLEL (≤30°), near-COLLINEAR (≤1 m perp), OVERLAPPING shell wall, and PROJECT the window's centre onto it (the reversed case falls out of the projection). Exact-match behaviour + all 14 prior tests preserved; +4 non-orthogonal regression tests (18/18). Unblocks windows on angled plots (the founder's Córdoba parallelogram). | ✅ DONE |
| **A.21.D2** | ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-06-05 (`§RECTIFY-QUAD`, `59f1cfaa`)** — Non-orthogonal layouts collapsed to ONE giant room + slivers | Root cause: `principalAxisAngle` (runDeterministicLayout) only aligns the shell's DOMINANT edge family; a parallelogram's other two edges stay slanted, so `rectDecomposition.decomposeToRects` stair-steps them into one big central rect + sub-minCell slivers → `subdivide` crams every room into the 57 m² rect ("93 m² merged blob") + drops slivers (§HARD-MIN-SIDE) / forces the strip-slicer bailout. An off-axis RECTANGLE rotates to axis-aligned → works — exactly the asymmetry the founder hit. FIX: NEW `rectifyConvexQuad()` (called atop `decomposeToRects`) — when the principal-axis-rotated shell is a CONVEX QUAD (4 verts after collinear-removal, fill-ratio ≥0.5), rectify it to its axis-aligned bbox before tiling, so a skewed quad tiles as ONE clean rect = the same room canvas a true rectangle gives. Discriminator is vertex-count+convexity (an L-shape can fill its bbox MORE than a sheared quad), so L/U/T shells keep their notch-aware decomposition bit-identically. TRADE-OFF: interior partitions become rectangular in the rotated frame (fill the bbox); the OUTER shell stays the real drawn shape (emitted separately + `§EXTEND-TO-PERIMETER` still extends partitions to the true `shellPolygon`). RESULT: a 16°-rotated parallelogram (108 m²) → **8 rooms** (was 1 blob), matching the equivalent rectangle; RoomDetectionEngine separates them (7/5/9/10). 1544 ai-host tests green. Needs in-browser confirm on a real skewed GIS draw. Canonical doc: [SPEC-TGL §2.3 `§RECTIFY-QUAD`](../specs/SPEC-TGL-DETERMINISTIC-LAYOUT-ENGINE.md#§23--d2-quad-rectification-rectify-quad--non-orthogonal-plots). | ✅ DONE |
| **A.21.D3** | **Modal options ≠ wall execution** (`preview=24 … submitted=13`) | PARTLY by design: preview shows ALL walls incl. the shell; the build skips the shell (`skipExteriorWalls` — it already exists) → external_skip=11. The REAL defect is open-plan merge (`detected 6 / expected 8`) + WJR clamps changing the built geometry. FIX: render the preview from the SAME post-skip + post-WJR geometry the build uses, so what the user picks is what they get. | 🟡 HIGH |
| **A.21.D4** | ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-06-05** — Style (modern/classic/minimal/warm) does nothing | Style now drives furniture COLOUR + MATERIAL finish. NEW pure `furnishLayout/styleFinish.ts` (per-style, per-category palette: upholstered→fabric, case-goods→wood, else neutral). Threaded end-to-end: `buildFurnishCommands(...style)` stamps `color`+`material` → `CommandEventBridge` forwards `color` (type + emit) → `initTools §FT-FURNITURE` passes it to the legacy store → builders read `data.color`/`data.material` (e.g. WhiteSofaBuilder). Executor reads `style` from `getActiveBriefMetadata`. +4 tests (86 ai-host). Geometry still style-agnostic (finishes only — the right contract for v1). | ✅ DONE |
| **A.21.D5** | **Room layout quality** (proportions, corridors, allocation) | Broad — the D-TGL subdivision/squarify quality. Overlaps the existing [single-apartment-fix-pass-spec] (§AREA-FRACTIONS / §KITCHEN-DISTINCT / §SEALED-ROOMS shipped; master over-allocation + corridor-links-all + proper programme remain) + the [dimensional + topology validators framework]. ✅ **D5.NAMES FIXED 2026-06-05 (`§ROOM-NAME-NEAREST`)**: rooms showed generic "Room 00-NNN" on skewed builds (founder "all of the rooms are room") — the post-generate naming matched D-TGL→detected rooms by centroid-INSIDE-polygon, which fails when the built geometry is offset from the plan; added a NEAREST-centroid fallback so every detected room keeps its semantic name + occupancy. **FOUNDER QUEUE 2026-06-05 (skewed-plan testing, still open):** (D5.a) **room CONNECTION ≠ modal preview** — the built adjacency/doors diverge from the picked layout (relates D3); (D5.b) **corridors insufficient + mis-placed** — often too few/short, and a corridor should AVOID façade frontage (façade = priority for window/light rooms, not circulation) → bias corridors interior; (D5.c) **not enough windows** — more rooms should get glazing (windowable set / multi-window on long façades); (D5.d) **adjacency rules** (program-rules DB / wallsAndDoors): a BEDROOM must connect to a corridor (not be reachable only through another bedroom); a BATHROOM to a corridor OR a bedroom (ensuite); enforce in the door/permeability pass + the [architectural-program-rules] permission matrix + bubbleGraph. Refs [[program-rules-improvements-queue-2026-05-29]] + [[single-apartment-fix-pass-spec]]. ✅ **NO-SILENT-DROP FIXED 2026-06-06 (`§FEASIBILITY-ALLOC`)** — the subdivider silently dropped a requested bedroom when its squarified short side fell below the per-type floor; now `placeInRect` REBALANCES area (shrinks over-allocated neighbours toward their minima) so a starved room reaches its min before any drop, and a genuinely-infeasible room is REPORTED via a structured `DroppedRoom`/`subdivideWithReport` field → `candidate.droppedRooms` (enumerate prefers the fewest-drop strategy + logs the shortfall) instead of vanishing. Hard-min invariant kept; +8 tests; ai-host 1592/1592. EDITOR FOLLOW-UP: surface `droppedRooms` ("reduced program") in the modal/toast. | 🟡 HIGH |
| **A.21.D6** | **Climate-driven design** (windows + layout respond to sun / wind / shadow / temperature) | The Phase-2 [APARTMENT-COGNITION-STACK] differentiator. 🟢 **D6.1 FOUNDATION SHIPPED 2026-06-05** — sun-oriented WINDOW placement: NEW pure `windowEmission/solarOrientation.ts` (`equatorFacingDir(lat)` → S in N-hemisphere / N in S-hemisphere; `outwardNormal`; `orientationFit`; `solarLengthMultiplier` = `1 + weight·fit`) + `emitWindowsForRoom` gains an optional `solar` bias that ranks candidate external walls by **length × sun-orientation** (a sun-facing façade beats a marginally-longer wrong-facing one; a much-longer wall still wins — orientation tunes, not overrides). No-op when absent → 0 regression (34 tests incl. 11 new). ✅ **D6.2 ACTIVATION SHIPPED 2026-06-05 — climate-driven windows now LIVE end-to-end**: editor `gatherLayoutPayload` stamps `siteLatitudeDeg` from `getCurrentSiteOrigin().lat` → `ApartmentGenerateLayoutPayload` → `workflow.ts` → `GenerateLayoutInput.siteLatitudeDeg` → `generateDeterministicLayouts(…, {latDeg})` computes the world equator-facing dir, rotates it by the principal-axis `−angle` into the emit frame → `emitGeometry(graph, {solar})` builds a per-room `SolarBias` (sunDir + room centroid) → `emitWindowsForRoom` ranks walls by length×orientation. So a generated apartment now puts windows on the sun-facing façade of every corner room (N-hemisphere → south; S-hemisphere → north). ai-host 63 window/tgl tests green; editor + ai-host typecheck clean. ✅ **D6.3 GLAZING-SIZE SHIPPED 2026-06-05** — passive-solar window SIZING: new pure `climateGlazingFactor(latDeg, fit)` ∈ [0.85,1.25] (COLD high-|lat| climates ENLARGE sun-facing glazing for winter gain up to +25%; HOT low-|lat| SHRINK to limit overheating; temperate pivot ~37.5° neutral). `emitWindowsForRoom` scales the chosen window width (clamped to wall-fit) + height by the factor for that wall's sun-orientation; `latDeg` rides the SAME thread as D6.2 (`SolarBias.latDeg` ← `EmitGeometryOpts.solar.latDeg` ← `generateDeterministicLayouts` ← `siteLatitudeDeg`), so no new editor wiring. +6 tests (69 ai-host green). Then **D6.4** layout (living/sleeping toward sun, service toward cold side) + wind. Climate substrate now LIVE (A.10.g bundled-first). Canonical doc: [SPEC-TGL §2.4 climate-driven windows](../specs/SPEC-TGL-DETERMINISTIC-LAYOUT-ENGINE.md#§24--d6-climate-driven-windows-sun-oriented-placement--passive-solar-sizing). | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (D6.1 done) |
| **A.21.D7** | ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-06-05** — Generation + furnish too slow (founder: "AI generation too slow", "furniture too slow") | Confirmed from the live log: every openings batch (`elements=9`) AND the 40-element furnish batch sat **8.0 s** — almost entirely `[BatchCoordinator] WATCHDOG: signalBuildQueueDrained() not called within 8 s — force-completing`. That signal is ONLY fired by the WallFragmentBuilder rAF-drain when ITS queue empties; openings-only and furnish-only batches build NO walls → the wall queue is never populated → the signal never fires → the batch waits the full watchdog with render suppressed (geometry was in scene at ~150 ms). FIX (`§A.21.D7-FIX` idle-probe, `3cffd84d`): the 8 s watchdog is now only the ULTIMATE backstop. WallBuilderControl/CW/Slab gain optional `hasPendingBuilds()`; WallFragmentBuilder exposes `get hasPendingBuilds`; WallRebuildCoordinator's `__wallRebuildControl` reports queued events/flush-rAF/builder-queue; BatchCoordinator arms a re-arming `pre-render` probe that completes the batch once every control is idle for 2 frames (~32 ms) instead of 8000 ms. `signalBuildQueueDrained()` made idempotent (`_drainSignalled`) against probe/builder/watchdog races; reset in `_setupBatch`/`forceReset`. Accelerates BOTH apartment generation and furniture furnishing (shared root cause). Backward-compatible (no `hasPendingBuilds` → legacy watchdog). Editor typecheck clean. | ✅ DONE |
| **A.21.D-FLOOR** | ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-06-05** — Flooring looks like flat "coloured rooms", not realistic finishes | The pipeline ALREADY auto-fires `CreateFloorsByRoomTypeCommand` on `apartment.layout-executed` (one floor per room, parallel to ceiling), but every floor rendered with the flat `#D4C4A8` fallback (generated rooms carry no explicit `finishes.floor` → CreateFloorCommand default). FIX (`§A.21.D-FLOOR`, `0fb64052`): NEW pure `command-registry/src/floors/floorFinish.ts` — `floorFinishFor(occupancyType, style)` → {finishColor, finishPattern, materialName}: wood plank (engineered oak / walnut-herringbone / pale ash / honey oak) for living·bedroom·dining·study, porcelain tile (small-format cool stone for wet rooms, large-format light stone for kitchen/service), across all 4 brief styles. `CreateFloorsByRoomTypeCommand` takes an optional `style` and stamps the resolved finishSpec per floor (CreateFloorCommand spreads it over its default; FloorPanelBuilder renders `finishSpec.finishColor`). `floorLayoutTrigger` reads the brief style (`getActiveBriefMetadata`) so flooring matches the furniture style chip. Editor typecheck clean. | ✅ DONE |
| **A.21.D-GLOBE** | ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-06-05** — 3D context buildings render in one fixed square + vanish on pan | Context buildings (keyless OSM via Overpass) were fetched ONCE for the site-origin bbox at view-open; `camera.moveEnd` only LOGGED the position. Beyond that square nothing loaded → founder's "buildings stop showing as I move". FIX (`§A.21.D-GLOBE`, deploy after `0fb64052`): `maybeRefreshContextOnPan()` on moveEnd reloads context buildings centred on the new camera ground point — gated (layer already active, camera height <~6 km, moved >~450 m from last load, 600 ms debounce); `loadContextBuildings()` aborts in-flight + clears prior entities so pans never leak/stack; timer cleared on dispose. NB the related "now don't render" report at Guadalajara was OSM data sparsity (Overpass returned 2 footprints there vs ~800 in Córdoba), not a regression — pan-refresh now loads denser areas as the camera moves over them. Editor typecheck clean. | ✅ DONE |
| **A.21.D8** | ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-06-05** — 3D globe shows only flat satellite, no 3D context buildings | `CesiumViewport.restorePhotorealMode` CLEARED the extruded OSM context buildings on exit-Forma, assuming "photoreal already shows real buildings" — true only WITH a token (Google 3D Tiles). On the keyless ESRI-satellite path the globe was left with no 3D buildings. Fix (`§GLOBE-CONTEXT-BUILDINGS`): only clear when `_cesiumToken` is present; otherwise (re)load the extruded overlay so the keyless "3D globe" shows 3D context buildings on the satellite. | ✅ DONE |
| **A.21.D9** | **Boundary draw: live dimension labels** (founder 2026-06-06: "when defining the boundaries of the apartment or house — could add dimensions?") | While drawing the boundary polygon, show the running edge length (and ideally the angle) as a label on each segment + the live segment being drawn, so the user sizes the plot precisely. The boundary-draw tool already has the points; add an overlay dimension annotation per edge (mirror any existing dimension/measure overlay). UI work in the boundary/draw tool — verify in-browser. | 🔵 QUEUED |
| **A.21.D10** | **Multi-storey modal shows ALL storeys** (founder 2026-06-06: "if 2/3 levels, the modal should show the layout of the 2/3 levels, not only ground floor") | The "Choose a layout" modal renders only the ground-floor plan. For a house with `storeyCount>1` it must render a per-storey thumbnail (tabs or stacked) from `HouseLayoutResult.perStoreyLayout[]`. ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-06-06 by A.21.k** — the NEW "Choose a house layout" modal renders one per-storey plan thumbnail (ground→upper) per variant card from `result.perStoreyLayout[]`, so a 2/3-storey house shows all storeys' layouts. | ✅ DONE |
| **A.21.D11** | **Interior partitions overrun the perimeter walls** (founder 2026-06-06, screenshot 2 — partitions pass THROUGH the exterior shell) | `§EXTEND-TO-PERIMETER` extends interior partitions out to the true `shellPolygon` so they meet the angled shell, but on some shells it extends PAST the shell wall (no clamp to the shell segment intersection) → the partition pokes through the façade. FIX: clamp each extended partition endpoint to its intersection with the shell polygon edge (not a fixed over-extension). Pure ai-host (`tgl/emitGeometry`/`wallsAndDoors` extend step) — testable. | 🟡 HIGH |
| **A.21.D12** | **Windows render as a recessed panel, not an opening** (founder 2026-06-06, screenshot 2 — windows look like blind sunken rectangles, no glazing/void) | The window opening is cut but the glazing/frame either isn't built or the opening isn't punched through the wall body (single-volume vs segmented producer), so it reads as an inset panel. Investigate the window host-opening + glass builder on generated (non-orthogonal) shell walls; ensure the opening is a true void with a glazed pane. Renderer/geometry-window — needs in-browser verify. | 🟡 HIGH |
| **A.21.D13** | **Only ONE level created despite selecting 2** (founder 2026-06-06: "DESPITE I SELECTED 2 LEVELS ONLY ONE LEVEL WAS CREATED") | Root: the live prod path is the single-plate apartment generator (casa = A.21.a single-storey bridge); the floors>1 brief value is read but nothing mints the upper levels. ✅ **CONSOLE PATH SHIPPED 2026-06-06 (A.21.d–g)** — `apps/editor/src/ui/house-layout/HouseLayoutExecutor` + `window.pryzmGenerateHouse(n)`: mints L1…Ln via AddLevelCommand → per-storey fan-out → stairs (auto slab-void) → roof, one runBatch. Editor typecheck clean. ✅ **UI PATH SHIPPED 2026-06-06 (A.21.j)** — both onboarding entry points now route `casa-unifamiliar` → `generateHouseFromBoundary` (storeyCount from the brief `floors`, default 2, clamp [1,3]) inside the authored parcel, so "House + 2 floors" mints 2 levels via the house executor (NOT the single-plate apartment generator). REMAINING: per-storey modal (A.21.D10); single-undo-collapse of level creation (A.21.e caveat). See [SPEC-CASA §13.4](../specs/SPEC-CASA-UNIFAMILIAR-TYPOLOGY.md). | 🟢 UI + CONSOLE PATHS DONE (needs in-browser verify) |
| **A.21.D14** | **Some areas have no room** (founder 2026-06-06, screenshot 3) — `detected 8 / D-TGL expected 12` | TWO roots in the live log: (1) **`Room boundary polygon must not self-intersect`** repeatedly skips rooms in `ReDetectRoomsCommand` (the detected boundary self-intersects on the skewed shell) AND (2) the `CREATE_ROOM_BOUNDING_LINE` builder **threw** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'start')`, ABORTING the runBatch mid-drain so later boundary lines/rooms never built. ✅ **CRASH FIXED 2026-06-06 (`§RBL-PLACEMENT-GUARD`)** — `RoomBoundingLineBuilder.build` now skips a placement-less record instead of throwing (sibling of the prior §RBL-PROPS-GUARD). REMAINING: the self-intersect boundary on skewed shells (open-plan merge — `boundary lines not splitting`) → RoomDetectionEngine boundary repair. ✅ **CIRCULATION-COMPLETENESS HARDENED 2026-06-06 (`§CIRCULATION-REROUTE-TWOHOP`)** — the A.APT.SA.2 re-route now adds a pass 2c-ii: a private room with NO legal circulation-adjacent wall is routed onto the spine via ONE permitted, circulation-served intermediate room (e.g. bedroom→living where living opens onto the corridor) before falling back to the connected-but-warned `unroutedToCirculationRoomIds` diagnostic. Never crosses a forbidden pair, respects caps (relax last); +tests in the new suite; ai-host 1592/1592. | 🟡 HIGH (crash fixed; detection open) |
| **A.21.D15** | **Lighting + "screens" (mirror/TV) float ABOVE the level** (founder 2026-06-06: "old bug") | ✅ ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED (2026-06-06). NOT a per-level base bug (lighting + furnish executors both add `level.elevation` correctly; lights at `elevation + height` were already right). The bug was a **double/triple-counted mount offset** for WALL-MOUNTED furniture: (1) `CreateFurnitureCommand` baked `level.elevation + baseOffset` into `position.y`, then `FurnitureFragmentBuilder` added `baseOffset` AGAIN (`position.y + baseOffset`) → `floor + 2×offset`; (2) several wall builders (WallArt/WallMirror, BathroomMirror/TowelRail, WcMirror/Washbasin, CurtainRod, DryingRack) ALSO added `BASE = data.baseOffset` inside their geometry, and the **TV** hardcoded `PANEL_BOTTOM = 1.20` → up to `floor + 3×offset`. Floor items (offset 0) were unaffected — hence only wall items floated. Fix: ONE datum rule `worldY = floor + mountOffset`, applied once. New pure helper `furnitureElevation.furnitureWorldY` (4 tests); `CreateFurnitureCommand.position.y = level.elevation` (floor datum); `FurnitureFragmentBuilder` applies `+ baseOffset` once; the 6 violating builders + TV made FLOOR-RELATIVE (internal BASE = 0). Lighting untouched (already correct). geometry-furniture 20 tests + ai-host 1709 tests green. Verify in-browser (2-storey furnished house). | 🟢 DONE |
| **A.21.D16** | **Graph: much richer, "nourishing" semantics** (founder 2026-06-06: "MUCH MUCH MORE INTERESTING… room relationships, element relationships, REASONS WHY those elements are/were located in such location") | The current overlay shows generic `Element`/`Rule` nodes with generic `depends-on`/`violates` edges. Make it ARCHITECTURALLY MEANINGFUL: (a) ROOM nodes with `adjacentTo`/`connectsTo`/`circulatesVia` edges (the UBG already models these — surface them); (b) per-element RATIONALE ("this window is on the SOUTH façade for daylight"; "this door links Bedroom→Corridor per program-rules"); (c) human labels not `Element`/`Element`. Builds on GRAPH.4 + the [[building-graph-strategy]] UBG. The differentiator the founder keeps asking for. Pairs with [SPEC-LIVING-DESIGN-PARAMETERS §4.2](../specs/SPEC-LIVING-DESIGN-PARAMETERS.md#§42--a254--graph-linked-what-changed--why) (A.25.4 "what changed + why" overlay reads this graph). ✅ **DONE 2026-06-06** (`rationale.ts` + `buildBuildingGraph` enrich passes + overlay restructure; building-graph 51/51, editor typecheck clean) — human labels, room↔room `adjacentTo`, window→façade/door→linked-rooms rationale, inspect card sections. | ✅ DONE |
| **A.21.D17** | ✨ **Living Building Graph** (force-directed live space-relationship overlay) | A Canvas2D, physics-animated overlay of the building's SPACES and their relationship LAYERS — **adjacency · circulation · environmental/sun · acoustic · structural** — modelled as springs that settle into a layout MINIMISING tension across the active layers (settled state = the optimal spatial organisation for the questions you've toggled on). Consumes the UBG read-only via `window.__pryzmBuildingGraph` (re-syncs on `pryzm:building-graph-rebuilt`, re-entry-guarded — never rebuilds inside the listener); rooms only (furniture excluded), boundary-less/self-intersecting rooms skipped. Acoustic/environmental derived locally (loud↔quiet separation; sun-rich clustering); structural = wet/service riser clustering. NEW folder `apps/editor/src/ui/living-graph/` (own `LivingGraphOverlay`/`LivingGraphCanvas`/pure `forceSimulation`/`livingGraphData`/`livingGraphSchema`); brand white+#6600FF; **P3-compliant** (frame-bus tick → guarded setInterval fallback, NO raw rAF; stops on settle/freeze/dispose); deterministic (index-seeded scatter, NO `Math.random`). Console openers `window.pryzmOpenLivingGraph()` / `pryzmCloseLivingGraph()` + a `✦ Living Graph` launcher. **SUPERSEDES the static `⚛ Graph` view as the primary graph UI** (founder: wire the primary Graph button here — reconcile at merge).

| **A.21.D18** | 🪜 **House pipeline: I / L / U staircases + shape-matched slab void + housing roof** (founder 2026-06-06) | The stair COMMAND already supported I/L/U + auto-void + pitched roof; the multi-storey HOUSE generator only ever emitted a straight `I` run. ✅ **SHIPPED 2026-06-06** — (1) `stairCore.ts` `reserveStairCoreShaped(...)` chooses I/L/U from the available core box (long-thin/aspect≥2.2 → I; generous square availW≥2000 ∧ availH≥2800 → U; squarer mid availW/H≥1600 → L; tight → I fallback) + `splitRisersForShape(...)` (L/U ≈half each); `StairCore` now carries `shape`/`flights`/`landingDepthM`/`risersBeforeLanding`/`footprintMm` (additive); orchestrator resolves per-flight directions (flight1 along longer axis; L turns left, U reverses). (2) `HouseLayoutExecutor._createStair` emits the shaped `CreateStairInput` (flights + landings + turnDirection/secondRunSide + stepsBeforeLanding + `autoCreateOpening:true`). (3) **Void already matches** — `CreateStairCommand.autoCreateOpening` uses `computeStairFootprintRect` which bbox's ALL flights+landings → the hole fits L/U by construction (NO command change). (4) Roof: `_createRoof` converts the descriptor's `pitchDeg` (~30–35°, fallback 32°) → command `slope = tan(pitch)`, gable default / hip when `roofKind:'hip'` / flat only when `'flat'`, ~400 mm eave `overhang`, `baseOffset` = wall height. **Param gap:** `CreateRoofCommand` has no pitch°/eave param — pitch via `slope`, eave via `overhang`. +~17 ai-host tests (shape selection / split / carried flights).

| **A.21.D19** | ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-06-06** — Furnishing STYLE system: distinct MATERIALS per style (founder 2026-06-06: "different materials depending on the style") | EXTENDS A.21.D4. Replaced the four coarse chips (modern/classic/minimal/warm) with FOUR architecturally-grounded styles — **Nordic · Mediterranean · Minimalist · Classic** — each driving a DISTINCT material + colour per furniture CATEGORY (upholstery/seating · case-goods/wood · tables · metal/hardware · soft · neutral) + floor + wall-accent hint. `styleFinish.ts` rewritten around a reviewable PALETTE TABLE (style × category → {colour hex, material}); return shape UNCHANGED so `buildFurnishCommands` consumes it untouched. Nordic = pale ash/linen-grey/light-oak floor; Mediterranean = terracotta/ochre/olive + wrought-iron + terracotta tile; Minimalist = mono grey/white/black + glass tables + polished concrete; Classic = burgundy/navy upholstery + dark walnut + brass + herringbone/marble floor. BACK-COMPAT: old ids alias (modern→minimalist, minimal→minimalist, warm→mediterranean, classic→classic) + free-text synonyms (scandinavian→nordic, traditional→classic, …); default `nordic`. `floorFinish.ts` extended in lock-step (timber/wet/dry tables × 4 styles; minimalist kitchen = polished concrete, classic = marble + walnut herringbone, mediterranean = terracotta). Both typology manifests' `style` select updated to the 4 new options (default `nordic`); runtime reads `md.style` as a raw string through the normalisers so new ids flow with no executor change. WALLS: no wall-finish pipeline exists today → `styleAccentsFor().wallAccent` exposes the per-style accent as a hook + FLAGGED as a follow-up (did NOT invent a pipeline). +18 tests (`furnishStyles.test.ts`) — each of 4 styles distinct per category, aliases resolve, floors lock-step, defaults sane; full ai-host suite 1608/1608.

NEW pure `furnishLayout/wardrobeLayout.ts` (`planWardrobe`) — I/L/U wardrobe run along the bedroom's free (non-window/non-door) walls, sharing the placed-furniture obstacle set. `furnishRoom`/`furnishRoomCompound` gained a `FurnishOptions` ({kitchenLayout, wardrobeLayout, kitchenWashingMachine}) and route kitchen→`planKitchen`, bedroom wardrobe→`planWardrobe`. `validateKitchenFromFurniture` now reads the EXPLICIT sink/hob/fridge (NKBA-accurate, retiring the run-centre heuristic). **Part D (brief/UI):** NEW `kitchenLayout` select field on the apartment manifest brief (Auto/I/L/U); `FurnishLayoutExecutor` reads it (+`wardrobeLayout`) from the active brief + adds a kitchen washing machine when there's no utility room. **Tests:** NEW `kitchenWardrobeAppliances.test.ts` (18) + updated `furnishSolver` kitchen tests; ai-host green; ai-host + geometry-furniture typecheck clean.

| **A.21.D21** | 🏚️ **House v35 prod defects** (founder in-browser test 2026-06-06, post-v35) | Five real defects from the first live `House` generation: **(1) house design modal** (A.21.k) ✅ DONE — see A.21.k row. **(2) Roof offset/floating** ✅ DONE (see A.21.D21.G). **(3) Perimeter not closed** ✅ DONE (D21.G). **(4) Stairs crash into walls** ✅ DONE (D21.G — keep-out, Deviation A resolved). **(5) Graph auto-covers ALL rooms** ✅ DONE (D21.5). All five amended; needs in-browser re-verify on the next deploy. | 🟢 ALL FIXED (in-browser verify pending) |
| **A.21.D21.5** | 🕸️ **Graph slice: whole-project room graph by default (ALL storeys, no selection)** (founder 2026-06-06: "the graph should cover ALL rooms in the project + their relationships, WITHOUT having to select a node first") | The Living + static Building-Graph overlays already build the UBG on open and render every ROOM node + relationship edge without a click — but the UBG was **silently active-level-scoped**: `resolveLevelIds()` in `buildBuildingGraph.ts` read ONLY `bimManager.getAllLevels()`, which is **undefined on the real BimManager** (its method is `getLevels()`), so it fell through to the active-level-only fallback and upper storeys of a multi-storey house never entered the graph. ✅ **DONE 2026-06-06** — `resolveLevelIds` (§UBG-ALL-LEVELS) now tries EVERY level enumerator in turn — `bimManager.getLevels()` (canonical) → `getAllLevels()` (legacy alias) → `wallStore.getLevels()` → `projectContext.levels` — de-duplicated, first non-empty wins; the single active level is the LAST-resort fallback only, so one UBG aggregates rooms from **every storey**. §UBG-LEVEL-TAG — Living Graph `GraphNode` gained an optional `level` (humanised storey) so a multi-storey house's rooms are distinguishable. Both overlays render all nodes+edges on `show()` — no selection needed. +2 test describe blocks (two-storey aggregation + `resolveLevelIds` enumerator shapes). | ✅ DONE (engine + overlay; in-browser verify pending) |
| **A.21.D21.G** | 🏠 **House THREE geometry defects from the first live multi-storey HOUSE (prod v35)** (founder 2026-06-06: roof floating/offset off the footprint; perimeter shell not fully closed; staircase intersecting interior walls) | THREE root-caused fixes, apartment path BYTE-IDENTICAL (all new ai-host params OPTIONAL, default undefined; editor changes in `HouseLayoutExecutor` only). **Defect 2 — ROOF offset/floating (`HouseLayoutExecutor._createRoof`, editor-only):** the `RoofFootprint` contract is `polygon` = CENTROID-LOCAL + `centroid` = world anchor (the fragment builder positions the root group AT the centroid and adds the local-polygon mesh — it does NOT offset children by −centroid like the slab builder does). The executor was passing the ABSOLUTE world polygon AND the world centroid → every vertex landed at `world + centroid` (double-count) → the parallelogram-shifted-off-footprint, "floating" roof. FIX: subtract the world centroid so `polygon` is local; `centroid` stays world → roof sits ON the building, aligned. `roof.footprint` from the engine is (and is asserted) the WORLD shell perimeter. **Defect 4 — STAIRS crash into walls (RESOLVES Deviation A, SPEC-CASA §13.2):** the core was only an area-budget reduction (un-carved LOCATION) → partitions could cross the run. FIX (genuine keep-out, option (a)): `generateDeterministicLayouts` gains an OPTIONAL `keepOutRectsWorld`; the orchestrator passes the core rect; `enumerate.buildCandidate` SUBTRACTS it (new pure `subtractRectsFromRects` guillotine split in `rectDecomposition.ts`) from the decomposed buildable rects BEFORE `subdivide`, inflated by a 0.05 m clearance ring (= the subdivider's `ALIGNMENT_SNAP_EPS_M`) so the post-subdivide snap can't re-encroach. No room/partition tiles over the core; walls terminate at the core edge. Carved on every storey (incl. ground). **Defect 3 — perimeter not closed on upper storeys (`HouseLayoutExecutor`, editor-only):** the engine emits an `isExternal` wall only where a room face touches a footprint edge → gaps where the tiling doesn't reach (dropped room / area cap / carved core) → open shell. FIX: every UPPER storey now EXPLICITLY emits the full footprint perimeter (one `wall.batch.create` per edge, pre-minted ids, `_buildPerimeterShell`) like the ground shell, with `skipExteriorWalls: true` on BOTH ground + upper so the engine's partial externals never duplicate it; the minted perimeter walls double as the storey's `shellWalls` (windows host on them, no read-back). CLOSED perimeter on every storey by construction. **Tests:** +7 ai-host (4 keep-out overlap in `houseLayout.test.ts` — no room bbox overlaps the core on 2/3-storey; 3 `subtractRectsFromRects` in `tglRectDecomposition.test.ts` — area conserved, no overlapping sub-rect). Full ai-host suite **1716/1716** (1709 baseline + 7); editor typecheck clean for the changed file (worktree has no node_modules → verified by filtering tsc output to `HouseLayoutExecutor.ts` = zero errors, the rest is missing-dep noise). SPEC-CASA §7.2 (roof frame) + §7.3 (keep-out + perimeter) + §13.2 (Deviation A RESOLVED) updated. **NEEDS IN-BROWSER VERIFY:** generate a 2-storey house → roof sits ON the building aligned to the footprint; all perimeter walls present + closed on every storey; stair sits in a clear void, no wall crossing it. | ✅ DONE (ai-host + editor; in-browser verify pending) |
| **A.21.D21.M** | **House builds layout DIRECTLY with no options** (founder 2026-06-06: "the house wants the SAME 'Choose a layout' modal the apartment flow shows") | The multi-storey HOUSE path generated + built option[0] silently — no chooser, unlike the apartment flow. ✅ **MODAL SLICE FIXED 2026-06-06 (= A.21.k)** — House now opens a "Choose a house layout" modal with N variant cards (per-storey previews + score) and builds the picked variant. Built as a controller+modal layer (`HouseLayoutController`/`HouseLayoutModal`) over the UNTOUCHED `HouseLayoutExecutor` (only additive `variantIndex`/`variantCount`); N options from the new pure `generateHouseLayoutOptions(...)`. See A.21.k + [SPEC-CASA §9](../specs/SPEC-CASA-UNIFAMILIAR-TYPOLOGY.md). | 🟢 MODAL DONE (in-browser verify) |
| **A.21.D23** | 🌬️ **CLIMATE · WIND · WEATHER live in the Forma site view** (founder 2026-06-06: sun/shadow + climate-driven windows work, but the WIND ROSE sat empty (`No wind data — set a site + load climate`) and there was no live weather/temperature overlay tied to the site) | The PURE substrate was already complete — `@pryzm/climate-host` exposes `buildWindRose` (16-sector × 6-bin EPW aggregate, tested in `builders.test.ts`) + `buildMonthlyNormals`/`buildDesignTemperatures`/`buildDegreeDays`; the L3 `ClimateStore` + `climate.ensureForLocation` command synthesise a full `ClimateDataset` (wind rose from per-month prevailing dirs, design temps + HDD/CDD) from BUNDLED offline normals (instant, no network) with a background live Open-Meteo/PVGIS upgrade; the L5 `ensureSiteClimate` adapter + `windRoseBars`/`monthlyTempSeries` chart helpers + the `FormaSiteAnalysisControls` rose all existed. The GAP was purely editor-side: the panel relied on `GISAreaLayout.mountFormaAnalysis`'s fire-and-forget ingest (which can race the LTP-ENU origin) and only showed a one-line climate NOTE — no real weather card. ✅ **DONE 2026-06-06** (editor-only; `FormaSiteAnalysisControls.ts`): **(1)** the panel now PROACTIVELY runs `ensureSiteClimate(runtime)` on mount when a site is authored but no dataset is resolvable (guarded once/mount), so the rose + weather never sit empty on a real site — bundled normals land instantly, the `climateStore.subscribe()` repaints. **(2)** Wind rose upgraded from a single thin frequency line per sector to STACKED speed-band segments (6 Beaufort-ish bins, light→dark #6600FF) keyed off the aggregate's `speedBinHours` — a proper direction × speed-band rose. **(3)** NEW live weather/comfort card replacing the one-line note: a 12-month min/avg/max temperature band SVG sparkline (`monthlyTempSeries`) + a 2×2 chip grid (heating/cooling ASHRAE design temps + HDD/CDD base-18) keyed to the site, all repainting on the climate/site subscription. Keyed to the SAME site lat/lon the sun/shadow path uses (`siteModelStore` + LTP-ENU fallback). GRACEFUL: no site → quiet empty state ("appears once a site location is set"); site but rose all-zero → "needs an EPW with hourly wind". No new climate engine, no new deps; pure math stays in `climate-host` (L-low). **VERIFY (worktree has no node_modules):** single-file tsc on the changed file = zero errors in `FormaSiteAnalysisControls.ts` (rest is missing-`@pryzm/*`-dep noise); `buildWindRose` + builders already green in `climate-host` `builders.test.ts`. **NEEDS IN-BROWSER VERIFY:** author a site → open the Forma 3D/plan view → wind rose populated (speed-banded bars) + weather card (temp band + design-temp/degree-day chips) from real climate, keyed to the site. | ✅ DONE (editor; in-browser verify pending) |
| **A.21.D24** | 🏠 **House roof: TWO defects on the v36 multi-storey HOUSE** (founder 2026-06-06: roof sits on the 1st storey not the TOP; roof geometry wrong on a non-90° / skewed footprint) | House-only; apartment path untouched. **Defect 2 — roof on the WRONG level:** the prior `autoBaseOffset: true` rule re-derived the roof base offset from `wallStore.getByLevel(topLevelId)` AT command time, but the top-storey walls are dispatched on the ASYNC bus and aren't committed when the synchronous roof command runs in the same `runBatch` → racy/empty lookup. ✅ **FIXED 2026-06-06 (`§ROOF-LEVEL`, `HouseLayoutExecutor._createRoof`, editor-only):** the executor passes the TOP `StoreyPlate` into `_createRoof`, targets `levelId = topStorey.levelId` EXPLICITLY, and sets a DETERMINISTIC `baseOffset = top-storey wall height` with `autoBaseOffset: false` → `RoofFragmentBuilder` resolves `worldY = topStorey.elevationM + wallHeightM` = the head of the uppermost storey's walls, for any storeyCount (1/2/3). **Defect 1 — gable broken on a skewed footprint:** `RoofGeometryBuilder.generateGable` built the ridge from the AXIS-ALIGNED bbox (ridge along world X/Z), so on a rotated/parallelogram plate the ridge sheared into a broken gable. ✅ **FIXED 2026-06-06 (`§RIDGE-PRINCIPAL-AXIS`):** (a) new pure THREE-free `roofRidgeAxis.gableRidge` builds the ridge along the footprint's PRINCIPAL axis (longest-edge direction), centred on the perpendicular extent — byte-identical to the old build for axis-aligned rectangles (no regression), correct on a 16°-skew; (b) for a NON-quad / non-convex shell (`!isGableFriendly`), `_createRoof` degrades `gable` → HIP (polygon-offset, handles any convex footprint). +6 unit tests in `packages/geometry-roof/__tests__/roofRidgeAxis.test.ts` (rotation-following axis, ridge parallel to long façade, L/hexagon/degenerate → hip fallback). Determinism preserved (no `Math.random`), no new deps. SPEC-CASA §7.2 updated. **VERIFY (worktree has no node_modules):** verified by inspection + parity (the editor already imports `@pryzm/geometry-roof` in 7 other files; geometry-roof tsconfig excludes `__tests__`). **NEEDS IN-BROWSER VERIFY:** 2-storey SKEWED house → roof caps the TOP storey, aligned + correct shape on the angled footprint. | 🟢 DONE (geometry + editor; in-browser verify pending) |
| **A.21.D22** | 🎛️ **House modal: DYNAMIC parameter editing (live regenerate, apartment-parity)** (founder 2026-06-06: "let the user change house parameters on the fly and the options regenerate live — like the apartment modal") | The "Choose a house layout" modal was static option cards only. ✅ **SHIPPED 2026-06-06** — ports the apartment `§MODAL-DYNAMIC` idiom to the house modal: an inline program-edit form (white + #6600FF) lets the user edit **Floors (1–3)**, **Bedrooms (0–5)**, **Bathrooms (1–3)**, **Living room**, **Open-plan kitchen + dining**, **Master en-suite**, plus the **A.25 design sliders** (Daylight/Privacy/Kitchen/Compactness → `ScoringWeights`, 0–100 → 0–1). A form change is **debounced 250 ms** (`setTimeout`, P3 — no raw rAF) → the controller re-runs the **PURE synchronous `generateHouseLayoutOptions(...)` DIRECTLY** (NOT the apartment's async relay/`options-ready` event round-trip — the house generator is an offline deterministic L2 call, so a direct call is correct + simpler) → `HouseLayoutModal.refresh(variants)` swaps just the card grid with an `alm-busy` "Regenerating…" dim. **Changing Floors** re-runs with the new `storeyCount` → the engine re-enumerates per-storey + the cards reflect the new floor count. Picking a card still builds that exact variant via the executor's `variantIndex` path, now against the LATEST edited program/storeys/weights (controller caches a mutable regenerate context; passes `variantCount: HOUSE_OPTION_COUNT` so preview ↔ build indices align). **Additive only:** executor + `generateHouseLayoutOptions` signatures UNCHANGED; apartment modal UNTOUCHED; no `Math.random`, no new deps. Files: `HouseLayoutModal.ts` (form + debounce + `onProgramChange`/`refresh`/`setBusy`), `houseModalHtml.ts` (new pure `buildHouseProgramEditFormHtml` + `HouseProgramFormState` + form-state param on `buildHouseModalHtml`), `HouseLayoutController.ts` (cached `_regen` context + `_computeVariants`/`_regenerate`/`_build`), `styles/panels/apartmentLayoutModal.ts` (shared `.alm-program-slider*` CSS). Editor typecheck: worktree has no node_modules → verified by filtering tsc output to the 4 changed files = ZERO errors (only env-wide missing-dep noise remains; `@pryzm/ai-host` DOES resolve, so the house files' types against `ApartmentProgram`/`ScoringWeights`/`ScoredHouseLayoutOption`/`generateHouseLayoutOptions` ARE checked). SPEC-CASA §9 updated. **NEEDS IN-BROWSER VERIFY:** House → modal opens → change Bedrooms/Floors → cards regenerate live → pick → builds the edited variant. | 🟢 DONE (in-browser verify pending) |
| **A.21.D24** | 🏠 **House v36 prod test defects** (founder in-browser test 2026-06-06, post-v36 — house VOLUME now good) | Seven defects: (1) Roof wrong on non-90° footprints → RoofFragmentBuilder/_createRoof non-axis-aligned polygon handling. (2) Roof on the WRONG level (1st not TOP storey) → _createRoof baseOffset/levelId. (3) 3D-globe shows ONLY ground-floor walls (no 2nd storey/roof); user must see ALL floors or pick which → CesiumThreeBridge level export is active/ground-only. (4) Stairs orthogonal to plan even when skewed → stair placement ignores the layout principal-axis rotation. (5) Furnish AI does NOTHING (pryzmFurnishAllRooms/AI button → no furniture) → FurnishLayoutExecutor path broken (no furnishable rooms on active level / event-identity wiring). (6) Graph too basic — Living Graph needs richer content. (7) 3D climate graphs in Forma (heat·sun·wind·warmth·circulation), not just D23 2D rose+temp; D23 rose still No-wind-data — ensureSiteClimate not firing on the house handoff. | 🔴 HIGH (post-v36 demo defects) |
| **A.24** | 🎨 **Dual render tiers — Massing (Forma) + Presentation (Spacio)** (founder-requested 2026-06-05: "an option more simple like Forma — and another like Spacio — way nicer and detailed") | TWO deliberately distinct visual tiers, switchable on the 3D view. **T-MASS (Massing)** = the Cesium site view (clean pastel/white blocks + white OSM context + soft ground shadow) — largely SHIPPED ([SPEC-FORMA-SITE-VIEW](../specs/SPEC-FORMA-SITE-VIEW.md) + §10 A.21.D-FORMA). **T-PRES (Presentation)** = the EXISTING **BIM 3D WebGPU view** (real walls/windows/balconies/handrails already render via PascalSceneLighting + SSGI + soft shadows) put into a **presentation render mode**: studio ground + soft gradient sky + soft sun/AO + **entourage** (trees + scale people) + **white-model / use-coloured material presets** — the clean white-architectural-model look (NOT photoreal; Spacio itself is non-photoreal). KEY: T-PRES reuses the BIM renderer — NO second engine. DESIGN OF RECORD = [SPEC-RENDER-TIERS-MASSING-AND-PRESENTATION](../specs/SPEC-RENDER-TIERS-MASSING-AND-PRESENTATION.md) (detailed founder-image analysis A/B/C + spacio.ai study + parity: PRYZM is AHEAD on substance — real windows/balconies/sun/climate/IFC — behind only on presentation polish).

Makes the site view read like the Forma reference (streets, not just blocks). NEEDS a live-verification loop (Cesium render) — do via an agent or after a deploy-test cycle, not blind · **A.24.9 QUEUED — Forma "horizontal line" artifact** (founder): a faint horizontal band in the grey Forma ground — likely the globe ellipsoid horizon / a coplanar imagery seam; investigate `setFormaMode` ground + horizon culling. Out of scope: photoreal PBR, face-level push-pull editing (Image C gizmo). Rendering-only (C04); P2/P5/P6/P7 untouched. | 🔵 QUEUED (DRAFT spec) |

Each slider feeds the EXISTING substrate — `ScoringWeights` (score.ts), the O.12 typology `briefSchema` (range/stepper/select fields), the [architectural-program-rules] permission matrix, and the D6 `SolarBias.weight`/`siteLatitudeDeg` — and re-runs `generateDeterministicLayouts` (fast, offline) to update the layout LIVE. Pairs with the now-interrogable Building Graph (GRAPH.4: nodes/edges/rules explained) so the user SEES *why* the design changed. **DESIGN OF RECORD = [SPEC-LIVING-DESIGN-PARAMETERS](../specs/SPEC-LIVING-DESIGN-PARAMETERS.md) + [ADR-0060](../../02-decisions/adrs/0060-living-design-parameters.md)** (parameters are typology-declared + bound to `ScoringWeights`/program-rules/`SolarBias`, re-running the deterministic engine — NOT a parallel scorer; C50 §2.6.5).

Composes the existing `ApartmentParameters` + `RoomParameters` records. Exposed via SUBPATH `@pryzm/schemas/aggregates` (root re-export would collide with existing `elements/Room` + `types/Id.RoomId`). NOTE: C20 §2.4 `Room.apartmentId: ApartmentId | null` is deferred to A.23.b — existing `RoomParameters.apartmentId` is non-nullable; widening migrates atomically with the L3 store wiring. 23 tests. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 1) |

ApartmentStore.list() sorts by buildingId then unitNumber; helpers `listForLevel` / `listForBuilding` / `findByUnitNumber`. RoomStore.list() sorts by levelId then name (case-insensitive); helpers `listForLevel` / `listForApartment` + `removeForApartment` cascade used by `apartment.delete`.

Then `CesiumViewport.renderFormaMassing` took `max(wall.height)` and extruded ONE footprint solid from the ground to that single height → every storey collapsed onto a single ground-floor block; upper storeys + a roof level never appeared. ✅ **DONE 2026-06-06** (rendering-only, C04; P2/P3 respected — THREE/Cesium unchanged, no raw rAF, no new deps): **(1)** `getFormaWalls()` now carries `baseElevation = baseLine[0].y + baseOffset` (+ `levelId`) per wall. **(2)** `renderFormaMassing` groups walls into **STOREY BANDS** by base elevation (0.5 m tolerance absorbs authoring jitter; sorted ground-up so band index = floor number) via new pure `groupWallsIntoStoreyBands(...)`, and extrudes ONE solid **per band stacked at its true elevation** (footprint per storey when a boundary is drawn; per-wall-at-storey-elevation fallback otherwise) — so all floors + a roof/parapet level (if its walls are authored) appear. Single-storey + apartment models have every wall at y=0 → exactly one band → BYTE-IDENTICAL to the old behaviour. **(3)** NEW floor-visibility control: a compact **"Floors" `<select>`** in the Forma view toggle bar (white+#6600FF, hidden until ≥2 storeys) — "All floors" (default) vs isolate a single storey; wired through new public `getFormaStoreyBands()` / `setVisibleFormaLevels(indices)` (re-renders the cached massing with the filter, no re-fly, no terrain re-clamp). New input field `walls[].baseElevation?` + `visibleLevels?` (both optional → back-compat). Files: `apps/editor/src/ui/layout/GISAreaLayout.ts`, `apps/editor/src/ui/geospatial/CesiumViewport.ts`. **VERIFY (worktree has no node_modules → tsc not runnable here):** reasoned type-clean; `cesiumViewport` is typed `any` in GISAreaLayout so the new method calls are safe; new fields optional. **NEEDS IN-BROWSER (Cesium render) VERIFY:** generate a 2-storey house → switch to 3D globe → BOTH storeys + roof appear stacked at correct elevations; the Floors selector shows All/Ground/1st… and isolating a floor hides the others; single-storey + apartment unchanged. | ✅ DONE (engine + selector; in-browser Cesium verify pending) |

| **A.30** | **C22 PII tier — partial ratification** | Multi-slice; broken into A.30.a (L0 schemas: DataTier · Region · DSAR · Consent · RetentionPolicy — DONE), A.30.b (L0 BreachIncident + StorageRoutingPolicy — PLANNED), A.30.c (L3 ConsentStore + RetentionScheduler — PLANNED), A.30.d (server DSAR worker + privacy UI — PLANNED). Refs: [C22](../../02-decisions/contracts/C22-PRIVACY-AND-PII-TIER.md), [phase-1-alpha §7.1](./roadmap-phase-1-alpha.md). | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (Sprint 2) |
| **A.30.a** | **L0 C22 privacy schemas (DataTier · Region · DSAR · Consent · RetentionPolicy)** | 4 L0-pure schemas in `packages/schemas/src/privacy/` exposed via SUBPATH `@pryzm/schemas/privacy`. (a) `DataTierSchema` — 4-tier closed enum (pii / project / telemetry / derived) per [C22 §2.1]; (b) `DsarRequestSchema` — DSAR audit row per [C22 §2.4] with cross-field invariants (dueAt ≥ submittedAt · type=rectify ⇔ patch · status=completed needs completedAt · status=in-progress|completed|manual needs verifiedAt); (c) `ConsentSchema` — per-purpose consent record per [C22 §2.6] (revokedAt ≥ grantedAt); (d) `RetentionPolicySchema` — per-tier retention config per [C22 §2.3] (PII maxBackupDays ≤ 90 enforced per §1.6 · maxBackupDays ≤ maxDays). 32 tests covering enum closure · DSAR type-coupling · GDPR-30-day clock · PII backup ceiling · trigger list closure. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.30.b** | **L0 BreachIncident schema** | New L0-pure schema in `packages/schemas/src/privacy/BreachIncident.ts`. Per [C22 §2.5] captures the breach lifecycle (suspected → confirmed → notified-authority → notified-subjects → closed). superRefine enforces: `detectedAt ≤ confirmedAt`, status-driven required fields (every status ≥ 'confirmed' needs `confirmedAt`; ≥ 'notified-authority' needs `authorityNotification`; ≥ 'notified-subjects' needs `subjectNotification`; 'closed' needs `closedAt`), `recordsAffected ≥ subjectsAffected` (a subject can have multiple records). `confirmedAt` start of the GDPR Art. 33 72-h clock per [C22 §1.9]. BreachRegion enum is `eu / us / ap` (excludes `self-hosted` since those are the customer's incident, not PRYZM's). AuthorityNotification + SubjectNotification sub-schemas extracted. 22 tests. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.30.c** | **L3 ConsentStore** | New L3 user-scoped store in `packages/stores/src/ConsentStore.ts` wrapping the L0 Consent substrate (A.30.a). Per [C22 §3.1] authoritative source for "is this user consented to purpose X right now?". `grant()` is idempotent on identical rows + auto-supersedes prior active versions of the same purpose (sets `revokedAt: grantedAt` on the older row; returns the superseded rows so the L3 retention scheduler can fire the §1.6 `consent-revoke` purge). `revoke()` flips `revokedAt` on the active row + returns it (no-op when no active row). `purgeUser()` is the GDPR Art. 17 erasure path (hard-deletes every row for a user). Listener-throw isolation + idempotent dispose. 21 tests covering read API (activeFor latest-grant tie-break, isConsented, listForUser asc-order, activeForUser filter) · grant (idempotent · cross-version supersede · cross-purpose isolation · cross-user isolation) · revoke (success + no-op + audit-history retention) · purgeUser (Art. 17 erase + other-user isolation) · subscription + reset + dispose lifecycle. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.30.d.1** | **consent.* command surface (3 handlers)** | 3 pure command handlers in `packages/stores/src/consent-commands/` per [C22 §4]. (a) `grantConsent` — idempotent on identical rows + auto-supersedes prior active versions of the same purpose; emits `ConsentGrantedEvent` carrying the superseded rows so the L3 RetentionScheduler can fire `consent-revoke` purges. (b) `revokeConsent` — flips `revokedAt` on the active row; rejects with `no-active-consent` when no active grant exists (surfaces accidental double-revokes explicitly). (c) `purgeUserConsent` — GDPR Art. 17 erasure; idempotent (returns `rowCount: 0` for unknown users). 11 tests covering happy paths · cross-version supersede · cross-purpose / cross-user isolation · revoke success + no-active rejection + double-revoke rejection · purge other-user isolation + idempotent zero-row path · Zod validation throws. The L5 DSAR worker + privacy-settings UI (A.30.d.2) consume this surface. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |

| **A.31.a** | **L0 C23 Provenance schemas (AIArtefact + ProvenanceEdge + ContextSnapshot + RedactionRecord)** | 4 L0-pure schemas in `packages/schemas/src/provenance/` exposed via SUBPATH `@pryzm/schemas/provenance`. (a) `AIArtefactSchema` — the append-only audit row per [C23 §2.1] with cross-field §1.4 invariant (deterministic ↔ non-null seed) enforced. (b) `ProvenanceEdgeSchema` — DAG edge per [C23 §2.2] with exactly-one-of `toArtefactId` / `toElementId` + edge-kind ↔ target-shape coupling. (c) `ContextSnapshotSchema` — serialised model context per [C23 §2.3] bridging to C05 file-format via `projectStateSha`. (d) `RedactionRecordSchema` — PII redaction audit per [C23 §2.4] (counts only, never content; per-category sum ≤ totalTokensRedacted). 36 tests. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.31.b** | **L0 ProvenanceExport schema (signed audit bundle)** | New L0-pure schema in `packages/schemas/src/provenance/ProvenanceExport.ts` composing the 4 A.31.a schemas into the Ed25519-signed customer-facing audit bundle per [C23 §2.5]. superRefine enforces: `totalArtefacts` matches `artefacts.length`, `totalEdges` matches `edges.length`, `artefactsFrom ≤ artefactsTo`, every embedded artefact + edge belongs to the export's `projectId` (per §1.8 RLS pre-image). Signature shape captured: base64 Ed25519 + signing-key-id with the marketplace-key pattern. 15 tests. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.31.c** | **L3 ProvenanceStore + composeRuntime wiring** | New L3 store in `packages/stores/src/ProvenanceStore.ts`. APPEND-ONLY per [C23 §1.9] with two carve-outs: `updateApprovalStatus()` (§1.7) and `linkElement()` (§4.4 produced-element link append). Rejects edges that would close a DAG cycle (§1.3 — DFS implementation tracing out-edges from the target back to the source). Snapshots dedup by `contextHash` (§2.3 — calling `addOrReuseSnapshot` with an existing hash returns the prior row). Composes into `runtime.provenanceStore` slot in composeRuntime; dispose chain wired. 35 tests covering read API · append-only enforcement · DAG cycle rejection (self-loop / 2-node / 3-node / diamond passes) · snapshot dedup · approval-status carve-out (mutates only that field, no-op on unchanged, throws on unknown) · linkElement idempotent + appends · reset + dispose + listener-throw isolation. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.31.d** | **provenance.* command surface (4 handlers)** | 4 pure command handlers in `packages/stores/src/provenance-commands/` per [C23 §4]. (a) `recordArtefact` — write a new artefact + idempotent on idempotencyKey per [C23 §1.11] (re-dispatch returns existing row + `deduplicated: true`); dedup scoped by projectId. (b) `linkElement` — append element ids to `producedElementIds` per §4.2; idempotent per element id; reject on unknown artefact. (c) `updateApprovalStatus` — flip approvalStatus per §1.7 with legal-transition graph (pending → user-approved | user-rejected | never-applied; auto-applied / user-approved / user-rejected / never-applied terminal); same-status is a no-op; reject on unknown artefact. (d) `queryByProject` — read-only filter per §4.3 (projectId required, optional `from` / `to` ISO-8601 window, optional `workflowKinds` exact-match filter). 26 tests covering happy paths · idempotency dedup (key + project scope + duplicate-id-different-key rejection) · idempotent linking · legal + illegal transitions for every starting state · same-status no-op · unknown artefact · query filter combinations.

| **A.31.e** | **L5 Inspect-tree Provenance tab + right-click menu (IP-A5 iter 5.2 + 5.2.b)** | Panel `apps/editor/src/ui/inspect/ProvenanceTab.ts` + orchestrator `ProvenanceMenuOrchestrator.ts` + `ModelTreeContextMenuPayload` hook on `ModelTree.ts`. Panel renders the C23 provenance graph for a selected element via `ProvenanceStore.listArtefactsForProject(projectId)` + filter by `producedElementIds.includes(elementId)`. Per-artefact card: model · workflow version · reproducibility (deterministic+seed / non-deterministic) · cost (USD magnitude formatted) · tokens · duration · cache status · timestamp · prompt SHA · produced-element count · redacted prompt preview as `<details>`. Approval badge uses semantic CSS classes (`pv-badge--success` / `--warning` / `--error` / `--info` / `--muted`). Subscribes to the store so live appends auto-rerender. `role="region"` + `aria-label="AI provenance for selected element"`. **Iter 5.2.b** wires ModelTree right-click → orchestrator → popover → "Show AI provenance" → panel mount. ModelTree's new `onContextMenu` hook is opt-in (back-compat); orchestrator filters menu items by `selection.kind === 'elementInstance'`. Tab is reused across right-clicks (selection swap, not remount). Esc + click-outside dismiss · Enter / Space activate · first item auto-focus. 48 tests (31 panel · 17 orchestrator). Demos: [iter 5.2 panel](../../05-guides/demos/IP-A5-iteration-5-2-provenance-tab.md) + [iter 5.2.b menu](../../05-guides/demos/IP-A5-iteration-5-2-b-provenance-context-menu.md). Final 5-line shell-wiring at editor mount lands in iter 5.2.c. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |

Refs: [C43 §6](../../02-decisions/contracts/C43-ACCESSIBILITY.md), [phase-1-alpha §7.3](./roadmap-phase-1-alpha.md). | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (Sprint 2) |
| **A.32.α** | **Static a11y CI gate (`check:a11y-contrast`)** | New CI gate script at `scripts/check-a11y-token-contrast.mjs` + root `pnpm run check:a11y-contrast` alias. Delegates to `pnpm --filter @pryzm/a11y-tokens exec vitest run __tests__/tokens.test.ts` — runs the A.34 audit in < 1 s, fails the PR if any declared (foreground, background) token pair drops below its WCAG threshold. Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 audit failed, 2 environment broken. The dynamic side (Playwright + axe-core walking the live editor DOM) is A.32.β. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.33** | **Keyboard registry + cheat-sheet UI** | Multi-slice; broken into A.33.a (L2 `@pryzm/keyboard-registry` package — registry + format helpers + cheat-sheet builder — DONE), A.33.b (L5 `?` cheat-sheet modal — PLANNED) and A.33.c (audit existing scattered key handlers + route through registry — PLANNED). Refs: [C43 §1.3](../../02-decisions/contracts/C43-ACCESSIBILITY.md). | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (Sprint 2) |
| **A.33.a** | **L2 `@pryzm/keyboard-registry` package** | New L2-pure package in `packages/keyboard-registry/`: (a) append-only `KEYBOARD_REGISTRY` of 35 shortcuts grouped into 7 categories (global / view / select / create / edit / navigate / inspect), (b) `validateRegistry()` boot-time guard that throws on duplicate ids OR combo collisions in the same context (alias collisions detected, experimental entries tolerated), (c) `formatKeyCombo(combo, platform)` platform-aware glyph rendering (`⌘ S` on macOS per Apple HIG, `Ctrl+S` on Windows/Linux per MS style guide), (d) `buildCheatSheetData(platform)` data generator the L5 modal renders. Pure: no DOM, platform passed explicitly (no `navigator.platform` sniff at file scope). 37 tests (registry: 15 · format: 12 · cheatSheet: 10). | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.34** | **Color-contrast token sweep** | Multi-slice; broken into A.34.a (L2 `@pryzm/a11y-tokens` package — registry + audit — DONE) and A.34.b (focus-ring + form-control border tokens — DONE). Refs: [C43 §1.5](../../02-decisions/contracts/C43-ACCESSIBILITY.md). | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.34.a** | **L2 `@pryzm/a11y-tokens` package (contrast calculator + token-pair audit)** | New L2-pure package in `packages/a11y-tokens/`. (a) `parseHexColor` + `relativeLuminance` + `contrastRatio` implement the WCAG 2.x formula deterministically (no DOM). (b) `checkContrast(fg, bg, {level, size})` returns `{ratio, threshold, passes, level, size}` with thresholds covering AA normal (4.5:1) · AA large (3:1) · AAA normal (7:1) · AAA large (4.5:1) · non-text (3:1, WCAG 1.4.11). (c) `PRYZM_TOKENS` registry of 14 canonical color tokens (brand purple #6600FF + 5 surfaces + 3 text grays + 4 semantic + 1 border). (d) `TOKEN_PAIRS` registry of 11 legal (fg, bg) usage pairs with declared `minLevel` per [C43 §1.5] (text-dense surfaces — inspect tree + data panel — gated AAA; everything else AA). (e) `auditTokenPairs()` runs the audit + returns pass/fail split. 28 tests covering hex parsing edge cases · WCAG luminance constants (white/black/grey) · 21:1 symmetric maximum · level-threshold escalation · text-dense AAA enforcement · the registry passes the audit cleanly · audit catches a known-failing fixture. Decorative panel borders exempted per WCAG 1.4.11 (documented inline). | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.34.b** | **Focus-ring + form-control border tokens (essential non-text per WCAG 1.4.11 + 2.4.11)** | Adds 4 new tokens to `PRYZM_TOKENS`: `focus-ring: #C2A4FF` (keyboard focus indicator), `form-border: #7E7E94` (resting input border), `form-border-focused: #C2A4FF` (focus state, aligns with focus-ring), `form-border-error: #FF5252` (invalid state, aligns with semantic.error). Registers 6 new `TOKEN_PAIRS`: focus-ring × 3 surfaces (ink / paper / paper-elevated — the surfaces a focused control can appear on) + form-border resting + focused + error on paper. All 6 gated `non-text` AA (3:1) per [WCAG 1.4.11 + 2.4.11]; PRYZM aspires AAA per [C43 §1.3]. Audit caught a too-dim `form-border` at 2.72:1 < 3:1 — bumped #5A5A6E → #7E7E94 in the same commit (the kind of real defect the audit is designed to surface). 30 tests covering the new tokens + the existing 28. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.35** | **C48 Backup + DR runbooks** | Multi-slice; broken into A.35.a (4 core failure-mode runbooks + index README — DONE) and A.35.b-d (insider access · plugin corruption · CRDT divergence — PLANNED, deps on C47/C08 ratification). Refs: [C48 §1.10](../../02-decisions/contracts/C48-BACKUP-AND-DR.md). | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (Sprint 2) |
| **A.35.a** | **4 core DR runbooks (DB primary · regional outage · ransomware · accidental delete)** | 4 new runbooks in `docs/04-reference/runbooks/` codifying the C48 §1.10 procedure: (a) [RUNBOOK-DB-PRIMARY-FAILURE.md](../../04-reference/runbooks/RUNBOOK-DB-PRIMARY-FAILURE.md) — 30-min RTO promote-read-replica flow, (b) [RUNBOOK-REGIONAL-OUTAGE.md](../../04-reference/runbooks/RUNBOOK-REGIONAL-OUTAGE.md) — 4-hr RTO cross-region failover with cold-backup fallback, (c) [RUNBOOK-RANSOMWARE.md](../../04-reference/runbooks/RUNBOOK-RANSOMWARE.md) — 24-hr RTO with quarantine-first + credential rotation + mandatory disclosure path, (d) [RUNBOOK-ACCIDENTAL-DELETE.md](../../04-reference/runbooks/RUNBOOK-ACCIDENTAL-DELETE.md) — 4 sub-cases keyed off tier-retention window. Each runbook follows the same 7-section skeleton (when-applies / symptoms / procedure / verification / post-incident review / related / drill cadence). Index at [docs/04-reference/runbooks/README.md](../../04-reference/runbooks/README.md). | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |

| **A.37** | **Cognition L1–L4 hardening — 100 new rules code-enforced** | 152 → 252 rules (out of 248-spec total; some are spec-expansion). Continuous Sprint 2–12; rules ship in batches keyed by cognition layer. First batch: A.37.α (G9 hierarchy validator — DONE). Refs: [phase-1-alpha §10](./roadmap-phase-1-alpha.md). | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (Sprint 2–12, continuous) |
| **A.37.α** | **G9 room-hierarchy validator** | New L2-pure validator `packages/ai-host/src/workflows/apartmentLayout/dimensions/validateRoomHierarchy.ts` closing the G9 gap from the dimensional framework. Catches layouts that PASS per-room G1-G6 but break architectural hierarchy invariants: H1 master < bedroom · H2 kitchen > living · H3 ensuite > bathroom · H4 non-social room dominates social zone · H5 corridor > bedroom · H6 wc > bathroom. All findings SOFT (penalty into `shapeQuality` / hierarchy axis); never HARD-rejects. Penalty scales with shortfall magnitude. 21 tests covering clean-pass + each H rule + delta-scaling + result-shape. Pairs with the existing 12 validators (validateRoomShape · validateRoomFit · validateKitchenTriangle · validateFrontage · validateAcousticZoning · validateCirculationSequence · validateCorridorConnectivity · validateForbiddenAdjacencies · validateMandatoryAdjacencies · validateWetCluster · validateApartmentEnvelope · validateKitchenFromFurniture). ai-host 1365 → 1386 tests. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.37.β** | **G8 room-daylight validator (windowless-bedroom guard)** | New L2-pure validator `packages/ai-host/src/workflows/apartmentLayout/dimensions/validateRoomDaylight.ts`. Closes the "windowless habitable room" anti-pattern called out in the single-apartment fix-pass spec (#5 NO windows): (a) HARD-rejects required-frontage rooms (master · bedroom · living · kitchen) with no aperture on any perimeter edge, (b) SOFT-flags preferred-frontage rooms (study · dining) with no aperture, (c) SOFT-flags habitable rooms whose aperture area is below 10 % of floor area (Building Reg habitability default). Service + circulation rooms (bath · wc · corridor · hall · utility) accept windowless by design. Window↔room association derived from axis-aligned edge-overlap geometry (no separate join required); partial overlaps + multi-window aggregation handled. 21 tests covering required HARD (master · bedroom · living · kitchen) + threshold edge cases + preferred SOFT (study · dining) + service-room acceptance + window-on-room geometry (far · multi · partial overlap) + result shape. Pairs with A.38 (the L5 daylight rule-checker UI consumes this validator's findings). | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.37.γ** | **L2 aggregate dimensional validator (`validateAllDimensional`)** | New orchestrator `packages/ai-host/src/workflows/apartmentLayout/dimensions/validateAllDimensional.ts` that runs validateRoomShape (G1-G6) + validateRoomHierarchy (G9) + validateRoomDaylight (G8) + validateCorridorWidth (L5 perceptual) + **validateEntrySightline (L5 perceptual, A.39.b)** and concatenates findings into one `DimensionalReport`. `admissible` is the AND of every sub-validator; the `perValidator` field carries the raw per-sub-validator results so the L5 modal can render per-section badges. `skipDaylight: true` lets early pipeline phases (D-TGL pre-window) skip the daylight gate cleanly; `skipSightline: true` similarly forces the sightline gate off. The D3.1 enumerate.ts gate + the L5 modal both call this single function instead of 5 separate validators. Bonus: fixed a latent type-mismatch where `validateRoomDaylight` expected `roomId` but received `RoomShape.id` — properly maps both fields now. 11 tests covering sound-fixture admissibility · per-validator breakdown shape · fault propagation from each sub-validator (windowless → G8 HARD, narrow corridor → corridor HARD, master < bedroom → G9 SOFT, bedroom-off-hall → sightline HARD) · skipDaylight + skipSightline short-circuits · combined-finding-count consistency. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.37.δ** | **L2 dimensional-report formatter (`formatDimensionalReport`)** | New L2-pure transform `packages/ai-host/src/workflows/apartmentLayout/dimensions/formatDimensionalReport.ts`. Takes a `DimensionalReport` and returns a JSON-serializable `FormattedReport` shape the L5 modal renders: 4 fixed sections (Room shape G1-G6 · Room hierarchy G9 · Daylight G8 · Corridor comfort L5) each with `pass / warning / error` status + hard/soft counts; per-room rows grouped by `roomId` carrying `worstSeverity` + per-finding `{metric, reason, severity, delta}`; rooms with errors sort before rooms with only warnings (deterministic ordering); a global `overallSeverity` + `totals` header. Pure L2 — no React / DOM. The L5 modal (A.38.b PLANNED) + daylight panel (A.38.a PLANNED) + perceptual panel (A.39.c PLANNED) all consume this shape. 11 tests covering overall severity buckets · 4-section invariant + display names · section status reflection · per-room grouping + sort order · single-room mixed error+warning · finding-field preservation. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.37.ε** | **L2 layout-summary formatter (`formatLayoutSummary`)** | New L2-pure transform `packages/ai-host/src/workflows/apartmentLayout/formatLayoutSummary.ts`. Takes a `LayoutOption` and produces a single-line architect-readable summary like `2-bed apartment · 69m² · master 16m² · bedroom 12m² · living 22m² · kitchen 8m² · bath 5m² · corridor 6m²`. Aggregates multi-room types with `×N` count tag; uses shortened labels (`bath` not `bathroom`); fixed type ordering (master → bedroom → living → dining → kitchen → ensuite → bath → wc → study → hall → corridor → utility) for determinism. Used by AI artefact `outputSemanticFingerprint` summary · modal "now showing" copy · log lines · telemetry payloads. 13 tests covering bedroom-count tag (studio + 1/2/3-bed) · area rounding · canonical type ordering · multi-room ×N aggregation · single-room (no ×N) · shortened labels · empty-layout marker · absent-type omission · separator format · full architect-readable example. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.38** | **L5 daylight rule-checker** | Multi-slice; broken into A.38.a (L5 daylight panel reading `formatDimensionalReport().sections.roomDaylight` — PLANNED) and A.38.b (L5 modal full integration — PLANNED). The L2 rule (A.37.β) + report formatter (A.37.δ) are the data sources. Refs: [phase-1-alpha §10.2](./roadmap-phase-1-alpha.md). | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (Sprint 2) |
| **A.39** | **L5 perceptual evaluator (corridor width · sightline · aspect ratio)** | Multi-slice; broken into A.39.a (L2 corridor-width — DONE), A.39.b (L2 entry sightline — DONE), A.39.c (L5 UI panel — PLANNED). Refs: [phase-1-alpha §10.3](./roadmap-phase-1-alpha.md). | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (Sprint 2) |
| **A.39.a** | **L2 corridor-width perceptual evaluator** | New L2-pure validator `packages/ai-host/src/workflows/apartmentLayout/dimensions/validateCorridorWidth.ts`. Closes the cognition-stack L5 perceptual layer for the corridor element. Comfort thresholds per UK Approved Doc M + WHO interior-comfort guidance: < 0.80 m HARD (accessibility floor) · 0.80–1.00 m SOFT cramped · 1.00–1.40 m comfort band (no finding) · 1.40–2.50 m SOFT wide (wasted circulation) · > 2.50 m HARD ('that's a room, not a corridor — reclassify'). Penalty scales linearly with deviation from comfort-band edges. Non-corridor rooms ignored. Degenerate (zero-area) corridors handled. 15 tests covering comfort-band edges (1.00 / 1.40 exact) · HARD floor + ceiling rejection · SOFT cramped + wide scaling · multi-corridor aggregation · non-corridor ignored · degenerate handling. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.39.b** | **L2 entry-sightline perceptual evaluator (compression-release pattern)** | New L2-pure validator `packages/ai-host/src/workflows/apartmentLayout/dimensions/validateEntrySightline.ts`. Builds an adjacency graph from rooms + doors, BFS from the entry room, then scores the compression-release arrival sequence per the cognition-stack L5 architectural-quality layer. HARD-rejects private rooms (master · bedroom · bathroom · ensuite · wc) within 1 door of the entry (privacy break — the front door must not open onto a sleeping zone). SOFT-flags when the entry room itself is NOT a circulation room (hall · corridor) — direct-onto-living misses the compression phase. SOFT-flags when the deepest habitable destination (master · bedroom · living) sits at BFS depth > 4 (over-buried, visitor walks through too many thresholds). Filters out the `__exterior__` pseudo-node, handles disconnected rooms gracefully. 17 tests covering sound-apartment pass · privacy-break cases (bedroom / master / bathroom / ensuite / entry-as-bedroom) · accepts depth-2 routing · entry-not-circulation SOFT (living direct / passes for hall + corridor) · depth-too-deep SOFT (chain of 5) + depth-4 accepted · degenerate inputs · result-shape invariants. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |

| **X.1** | NFT bench maintenance + new benches per shipped feature | Per-PR + per-feature | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (continuous) |
| **X.2** | C14 Cast-count tripwire — ratchet toward zero | Per-PR | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (baseline holds) |
| **X.3** | OTel span coverage — every new public function | Per-PR via `check-otel-spans.ts` | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (hard-fail gate) |
| **X.4** | Constraint DB rule curation | Continuous | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (A.37 active) |
| **X.5** | Customer support intake + SEV-1 PMI cadence | Per [C42](../../02-decisions/contracts/C42-CUSTOMER-SUPPORT-TIER.md) | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (low volume) |
| **X.6** | Documentation cadence per [C31](../../02-decisions/contracts/C31-DOCUMENTATION-AUTHORING-PROTOCOL.md) | Continuous | 🟢 IN PROGRESS (this commit) |
| **X.7** | Sprint retros + per-sprint planning | Per-sprint | 🟢 IN PROGRESS |

## §8 — Immediate next 5 actions (the "what's next" answer)

The 5 actions to do FIRST, in priority order, as of **2026-06-02** (rewritten — the prior 2026-06-01 list is closed: A.1/A.2 typology-pipeline shipped `172fc8c`, A.7 site substrate shipped, A.17 superseded by the ADR-055 apex/app split; `pryzm.app` retired for canonical `pryzm.so`). **All of IP-A5.X's code/config is now DONE on `main`; the critical path is now INFRA the user performs (1–4), then the Revit code-track (5).**

| Order | Sub-phase | Action | Owner | Time-box |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **A.17.x.12** | **Cloudflare repoint** — point the `pryzmapp` Pages project at build cmd `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && pnpm build:apex`, output `apps/editor/dist-apex`, branch `main`. **URGENT** — the Astro source is deleted from `main` (A.17.x.14), so the old docs-site build now fails. Verify: landing shows "Start here". | User (Cloudflare) | 15 min |
| **2** | **A.17.x.11** | **Fly first deploy** — **🟢 PREPPED 2026-06-03:** `flyctl v0.4.57` installed + on PATH; `Dockerfile`/`.dockerignore`/`fly.toml` validated (EU `fra`, health `/api/health/ready`); `.env` secrets mapped. **BLOCKED on the one interactive step only the user can do: `fly auth login`** (browser). After login the agent can drive the rest (app create — `pryzm` may be globally taken, rename if so → `pryzm-app`; `flyctl secrets import` from `.env`; `flyctl deploy --remote-only`). The `docker-image` CI job already validates the image builds + boots, so this is de-risked. | User (`fly auth login`) → then agent | 1–2 hr |
| **3** | **A.17.x.13** | **DNS** — `pryzm.so` → apex Pages · `app.pryzm.so` + `api.pryzm.so` → Fly · `docs.pryzm.so` → docs-site (A.17.x.15) · TLS auto. | User (Cloudflare DNS) | 30 min |
| **4** | **A.17.x.16** | **Supabase** — provision project in `eu-central-1` (Frankfurt) + upgrade to Pro for C48 PITR before the first paying customer. | User (Supabase) | 1 hr |
| **5** | **A.R.3** | **Revit round-trip code-track** — complete the `IfcMetaStore` wiring (plugin re-point → composeRuntime registration + C13 reset → ifc-import populates → ifc-export reads → `.pryzm` serialize/hydrate). Drives the §12.6.1 D.R lane vs ThatOpen's 2026-06-22 launch. | Engineer | 1–2 sprints |

Actions 1–4 are the deployment unblock (all user-side infra; every code prerequisite is on `main`). Action 5 is the highest-value code-track work that runs in parallel — the foundation shipped `1f3cea5`; the completion sequence is in §12.6 A.R.3.

Finding: the door mesh DOES move instantly (TransformControls, commit-on-release); the lag is `door.setOffset` → a **whole-level** synchronous wall rebuild (`WallRebuildCoordinator._flush`: `resolveLevel` + per-wall `buildWall` dispose/recreate + infill), O(walls-per-level) not O(1). **No per-frame CSG** (single-volume producer flag-off → segmented-box fallback). 3D↔plan switch verified ALREADY fast (camera toggle + cached plan projection, `FastPathProjectorService` sub-50ms) — not the gap. Fix: incremental single-wall openings-only rebuild branch. **✅ ADR-057 ACCEPTED — P1 SHIPPED 2026-06-03 (`ea11e457`)**: `WallDeltaClassifier` + `WallRebuildCoordinator._flushOpeningsOnly` → door/window offset edits rebuild ONLY the edited wall (O(1)), whole-level fallback for any structural delta; 20/20 geometry-wall tests. Door-move now instant. P2-P5 backlogged. |
| [PERF-PROJECT-OPEN-AND-BATCH-2026-06-03.md](../analysis/PERF-PROJECT-OPEN-AND-BATCH-2026-06-03.md) | **🟡 QUEUED perf (2026-06-03).** User: project creation + batch apartment generation too slow (live log: 768 ms/297 ms LONGTASKs, 1–8 fps during open). Root cause #1: the WebGPU **render pipeline is rebuilt on EVERY project-switch** (SSGI/outline TSL graph re-authored + GPU dispose/recompile — content-independent, 100% redundant) = the 768 ms LONGTASK. #2: batch generator's two-phase wall→door split gated by a 150 ms poll, each door triggering a whole-level wall rebuild. #3: 20+ `pryzm-project-loaded` re-binds per open. Engine bootstrap + empty data-load are correctly cheap. Quick win = build pipeline once/tab (A.OI.053d). Tracker rows: A.OI.053d/f/g/h/c/i. |

## §11 — How this tracker updates

- **Every sprint close** — update status (⚪ → 🟢 → ✅) on completed sub-phases
- **On any 🔴 BLOCKED** — surface in next standup; raise unblock plan
- **On 🔵 DEFERRED change** — record reason; raise ADR if material
- **On every new sub-phase** — add to the right phase table + check capacity
- **Quarterly close** — move closed sub-phases to a `Phase-A-CLOSED.md` summary; refresh capacity table

Per [cadence-and-planning-system §10 cardinal rules](./cadence-and-planning-system.md): plans flow down; reality flows up. When a sprint discovery invalidates a tracker assumption, update + raise an ADR.

### §12.3 — Phase A — Editor UI + Project Page additions (~14 wk)

Material UI work NOT covered in §3.1. Adds to Phase A:

| Phase | Goal | Description + refs | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A.U.1** | **Editor shell redesign for typology routing** | Top bar shows typology badge + role badge; typology-switcher in user menu. Refs: [product-vision §5 Step 2](../../01-strategy/product-vision.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 4) |
| **A.U.2** | **Property panel migration to Inspect tree leaves** | Existing flat PropertyInspector (80 files) → typed-leaf component per element type. Refs: [C27 §8](../../02-decisions/contracts/C27-BIM3-INSPECT-MODEL.md) migration plan. | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 5–8) |
| **A.U.3** | **CREATE panel: per-typology batch leaf catalogue** | Each typology contributes batch entries to the `CREATE › <Discipline>` panel per [C17](../../02-decisions/contracts/C17-BATCH-CREATION-CATALOGUE-AND-PANEL-BINDING.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 3) |
| **A.U.4** | **Settings panel restructure** (preferences · privacy · billing · accessibility · region) | Categorised settings; per-section deep-link. Refs: [C42 §5.2](../../02-decisions/contracts/C42-CUSTOMER-SUPPORT-TIER.md), [C43 §5.2](../../02-decisions/contracts/C43-ACCESSIBILITY.md), [C44 §5.x](../../02-decisions/contracts/C44-MOBILE-AND-TABLET.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 6) |
| **A.U.5** | **Tool registry UX refresh** | Per-tool icon + keyboard hint + tooltip. Refs: [C06 §4](../../02-decisions/contracts/C06-UI-SHELL-AND-TOOLS.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 4) |
| **A.U.6** | **Marketplace UX in editor (install panel)** | In-editor marketplace browse + install card; right-side install drawer. | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 4) |
| **A.U.7** | **Notification + toast system maturity** | Unified `AppToast` per [C06 §4.6](../../02-decisions/contracts/C06-UI-SHELL-AND-TOOLS.md); aria-live announce per [C43 §1.4](../../02-decisions/contracts/C43-ACCESSIBILITY.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 5) |
| **A.U.8** | **Search across editor + project** | Cmd-K palette: jump-to-element + jump-to-tool + jump-to-room + jump-to-typology. | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 8) |
| **A.U.9** | **Activity feed (per-project change history)** | Compact feed of last 50 commands; click to time-travel. Surfaces undo/redo + Ctrl-Z visually. Refs: [C13 §3.7](../../02-decisions/contracts/C13-PROJECT-LIFECYCLE-AND-ISOLATION.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 9) |
| **A.U.10** | **In-product help (the `?` icon + first-project tutorial)** | KB search + AI helper (per [C42 §5.1](../../02-decisions/contracts/C42-CUSTOMER-SUPPORT-TIER.md)) + report-bug + accessibility-issue links. | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 5–6) |
| **A.U.11** | **Onboarding tutorials (5-step interactive)** | "Generate apartment" · "Edit a room" · "Add a door" · "Save" · "Export IFC". Refs: [roadmap-enterprise-delivery §3](./roadmap-enterprise-delivery.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 5–6) |
| **A.U.12** | **Telemetry consent banner + cookie management** | Three-tier consent (Essential / Product / Marketing) per [C41](../../02-decisions/contracts/C41-TELEMETRY-AND-ANALYTICS.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 4) |
| **A.U.13** | **Support intake surface (help@ + in-product chat)** | 4-channel surface per [C42 §1.1](../../02-decisions/contracts/C42-CUSTOMER-SUPPORT-TIER.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 6) |
| **A.U.14** | **Mobile + tablet surface-capability matrix UI** | Per-form-factor `blocked` / `read-only` / `form-only` / `full` enforcement. Refs: [C44 §1.4](../../02-decisions/contracts/C44-MOBILE-AND-TABLET.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 7) |
| **A.U.15** | **Browser Tier 1 support detection + unsupported-browser landing** | Per [C45 §1.8](../../02-decisions/contracts/C45-BROWSER-AND-DEVICE-MATRIX.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 4) |
| **A.U.16** | **i18n en-GB locale bundle (TIER 1 fork from en-US)** | First locale split; messages/ folder set up. Refs: [C46 §1.2](../../02-decisions/contracts/C46-I18N-AND-L10N.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 6) |
| **A.U.17** | **File format `formatVersion` + writer signature** | First C47 enforcement. Refs: [C47 §1.1](../../02-decisions/contracts/C47-FILE-FORMAT-VERSIONING.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 7) |
| **A.U.18** | **Notifications inbox (in-product + email)** | Email transactional templates (welcome · upgrade · DR comm) + in-product inbox. | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 8) |
| **A.U.19** | **AI design-assistant panel: scrollable create-commands list** | User-reported defect: the AI design-assistant right-panel's create-commands list did NOT scroll when the catalogue overflowed the viewport — items below the fold were unreachable. Fixed in `apps/editor/src/ui/styles/panels/toolsRail.ts`: added `overflow-y: auto` + `overflow-x: hidden` + `scrollbar-gutter: stable` to `.tpr-create-root`. The `min-height: 0` on the flex child was already present; combined with the new overflow rule, content above panel-height now flows onto a scrollbar instead of clipping. Stable scrollbar gutter prevents the panel width jittering when the bar appears/disappears. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.U.20** | **`scripts/` folder taxonomy (flat → 7-folder)** | Reorganised 33 flat scripts into `scripts/{check,migrate,scan,build,cutover,legacy-pryzm3,one-offs}/` with a `scripts/README.md` describing the taxonomy + conventions (no inter-script imports · standard exit codes · header-comment naming the enforced contract · idempotent codemods). Updated 9 `package.json` aliases + 1 external `tools/ga-gate/run-all.ts` reference. Pure refactor — no behaviour change. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.U.21** | **Casa Unifamiliar typology UI (picker card · floors brief · per-storey modal · multi-level result)** | The house typology's editor surfaces: typology picker card + thumbnail (registry-driven, auto-appears once `casa-unifamiliar` registers); brief panel renders the floors stepper (new vs apartment) + house fields; generation modal shows per-storey plan thumbnails; result view adds a level selector (2D plan per floor) + reuses `LevelExplodeController` for an exploded "dollhouse" axon. Supports tracker `A.21.k`. Refs: [SPEC-CASA-UNIFAMILIAR-TYPOLOGY §9](../specs/SPEC-CASA-UNIFAMILIAR-TYPOLOGY.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 9) |
| **A.PL.1** | **Project Hub redesign (landing for signed-in users)** | Recent projects · starred · typology shortcuts · sharing inbox. Refs: [product-vision §5 Step 1](../../01-strategy/product-vision.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 5) |
| **A.PL.2** | **Project list page** | Grid · filter by typology · search · pagination · per-project context menu. | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 5) |
| **A.PL.3** | **Project create flow** | "New project" routes through RAC chatbot (per A.5 + A.6). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 4) |
| **A.PL.4** | **Project sharing UI (per-project member roles)** | Invite by email · ISO 19650 role assignment (collaborator/approver/publisher) per [C08 §1.3](../../02-decisions/contracts/C08-COLLABORATION-AND-SECURITY.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 7) |
| **A.PL.5** | **Project version history UI** | Per-version snapshot grid + revert + diff (basic). Refs: [C13](../../02-decisions/contracts/C13-PROJECT-LIFECYCLE-AND-ISOLATION.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 8) |
| **A.PL.6** | **Project settings (per-project unit-system · drawing-standard · members)** | Refs: [C46 §1.1](../../02-decisions/contracts/C46-I18N-AND-L10N.md), [C34](../../02-decisions/contracts/C34-PRINT-AND-DRAWING-STANDARDS.md). | ⚪ PLANNED (Sprint 7) |

### §12.4 — Phase B — Sheet + Inspect + Data UX additions (~10 wk)

The user emphasized: "making sheets, views, elevations great" — add sub-phases:

| Phase | Goal | Description + refs |
|---|---|---|
| **B.U.1** | **PryzmRuntime slot additions for sheet + inspect + data** | composeRuntime gains sheet/inspect/data slots typed. Refs: [C02 §1.2](../../02-decisions/contracts/C02-COMPOSITION-ROOT-AND-BOOT.md). |

| **B.S.3** | **Dimension + annotation tool UX great** | Auto-dimension run · annotation styles · leader lines · multi-line text · keynote-tag · revision-cloud · view-extents-clip. Refs: [SPEC-29-VECTOR-PRIMITIVES](../specs/SPEC-29-VECTOR-PRIMITIVES.md). |
| **B.S.4** | **Drawing-set UX great** | Drag-reorder sheets · auto-numbering · revision-state-machine UI · transmittal cover-page generator · PDF/A-3 export from drawing-set. Refs: [C30](../../02-decisions/contracts/C30-DRAWING-SET-MANAGEMENT.md). |

### §12.6 — Native Revit deliverables (full breakdown)

The user specifically called out "native Revit import + export". Per [C26](../../02-decisions/contracts/C26-REVIT-ROUND-TRIP.md), PRYZM uses IFC4 as the canonical bridge — there is no direct .rvt parsing in the monorepo (a deliberate architectural decision per C26 §1). Sub-phases:

> **2026-06-02 — code audit + competitive re-rank.** A full read-only audit (see callout below) found PRYZM is **materially further along than this table implied**: the IFC4X3-RV Revit-variant exporter, GlobalId preservation, and the `packages/schemas/src/revit/` schema surface are SHIPPED, and IFC import already maps 6 Tier-1 families to **native, command-bus-editable** elements (not static meshes). Statuses below are now audit-grounded. The remaining gap to the user's vision ("Revit project → PRYZM native elements → modify → back to Revit, *live*") is the **D.R live-round-trip tier** added below, prompted by ThatOpen Company's **That Open Platform** announcement (Revit live-collaboration; Founding-Member launch **2026-06-22**) — the same category PRYZM's C26 targets, so this is now a competitively time-sensitive lane.

| Phase | Goal | Status (2026-06-02 audit) |
|---|---|---|
| **A.R.1** | **IFC4X3-RV variant exporter** (Revit-import-friendly variant) | ✅ **SHIPPED** — `plugins/ifc-export/src/exporters/revit-variant.ts` (Pset_RevitType + Pset_RevitInstance + Workset `IfcGroup` + `IfcRelAssignsToGroup`; coordinate-mode pset is a stub). |
| **A.R.2** | **First reference round-trip: 1 Revit RVT → IFC → PRYZM → IFC → Revit** | 🟡 **PARTIAL** — import (Tier-1 native + Tier-2 transform-proxy, `web-ifc@0.0.77`) + export both exist; GlobalId + psets round-trip **IFF the meta-store is populated**, but the meta-store is `InMemoryIFCMetaStore` only. Blocker = **persistent meta-store (S55)**. |
| **A.R.3** *(new)* | **Persistent IFC/Revit meta-store** | 🟡 **FOUNDATION SHIPPED** `1f3cea5` — canonical `IfcElementMeta` schema at `@pryzm/schemas/ifc` (L0) + durable reactive `IfcMetaStore` at `@pryzm/stores` (L3): get/getByGlobalId/add/updatePset/updateQuantity/delete + `serialize↔hydrate` (Zod-validated, the `.pryzm` path) + `reset`/`subscribe`/`dispose`; 13 tests green. **Completion sequence:** (1) ✅ **re-pointed both plugins to the canonical shape** via the plugin-sdk (L6) facade — `plugin-sdk` re-exports `@pryzm/schemas/ifc`; `ifc-export` + `ifc-import` alias `IfcElementMeta`/`Pset`/`Qset`/`PsetValue`/`IfcElementTier` from it (3 near-identical copies → 1; plugin-sdk + both plugins typecheck clean, 252 + 28 tests green); (2) ✅ **registered in `composeRuntime`** — `runtime.ifcMetaStore` (construct+expose+dispose; 132 runtime tests green); the reset into the *distributed* C13 project-switch path is still pending (no consumer needs it until import populates); (3) 🟡 **command surface built** — `@pryzm/stores/ifc-commands` `registerIfcMeta`/`deregisterIfcMeta` (the P6-clean mutation path; pure `(payload, store) → IfcCommandResult<Event>`, mirrors `consent-commands`; 5 tests green) — remaining: bus-registration + `ifc-import` dispatching `ifc.meta.register` after producing metas (depends on the S55 import-pipeline call-site); (4) ⚪ `ifc-export` reads via `get()`; (5) ⚪ `.pryzm` save/load calls `serialize()`/`hydrate()`. **The single highest-leverage unlock** — converts the existing half-round-trip into a real one. |
| **B.R.1** | **10-project reference round-trip nightly** | ⚪ Suite of 10 representative Revit projects; CI nightly diff-check. |
| **B.R.2** | **Revit Family mapping table** | 🟡 Schema EXISTS (`packages/schemas/src/revit/RevitFamilyMapping.ts`); the populated RFA→element matrix for the canonical 100 categories is pending. Refs: [C26 §3](../../02-decisions/contracts/C26-REVIT-ROUND-TRIP.md). |
| **B.R.3** | **Parameter translation via IfcPropertySet** | 🟡 Export writes psets/qsets; import preserves them in `IFCElementMeta.psets` + `_ifcCustom` bag. Solid on the IFC path; Revit shared-parameter fidelity needs B.R.2 + the adapter. |
| **C.R.1** | **Optional external Python/C# Revit add-in** | ⚪ Out-of-monorepo per C26 §6.3 (Windows COM + Revit API). The only path to phasing / worksets / design-options + *live* push-back. Refs: [C26 §6](../../02-decisions/contracts/C26-REVIT-ROUND-TRIP.md). |
| **C.R.2** | **100-project reference suite (Enterprise validation)** | ⚪ Expand nightly diff suite to 100 representative projects across building types. |
| **C.R.3** | **Revit-import wizard (in-editor)** | ⚪ Drag-drop .rvt → server-side conversion via IFC → in-editor preview → accept. |
| **C.R.4** | **Revit-export wizard (in-editor)** | ⚪ "Export to Revit" UI flow → IFC4X3-RV → save dialog → optional adapter trigger. |

#### §12.6.1 — D.R — Live Revit ↔ PRYZM round-trip (the "That Open Platform" lane)

The user's framing — *"Revit project into PRYZM as native elements through a plugin — modify elements — back to Revit!"* — is the **live, collaborative** evolution of the file-based round-trip above (ThatOpen's pitch: no long export/import · full change history · go back in time · keep data control). The audit's gap analysis sizes it at **~12–15 sprints on top of A.R.3**. Architecture note: the *in-editor* half is a PRYZM L7 plugin (registers a format/connector via the plugin SDK), but the *Revit-side* half MUST be a separate Windows add-in (Revit runs desktop COM, not in the browser) — so "a plugin" is really **two** cooperating pieces bridged over a websocket/event channel.

| Phase | Goal | Builds on / Gap |
|---|---|---|
| **D.R.1** | **Streaming delta import** (Revit change → PRYZM command) | Builds on command-bus + sync-server event log; NEW = WS bridge from the desktop adapter + Revit-delta→command translator. ~3–4 sprints. |
| **D.R.2** | **Bidirectional property/parameter push-back** (PRYZM edit → Revit) | Builds on the pset round-trip; NEW = PRYZM event → adapter → Revit API write. ~2–3 sprints. |
| **D.R.3** | **Change history / time-travel** ("go back in time") | Builds on the durable sync-server event log; NEW = version snapshots + revert-to-version surface (undo ring-buffer is bounded, not sufficient). ~2 sprints. |
| **D.R.4** | **Revit-aware conflict resolver** (Revit-user A vs PRYZM-user B edit same element) | Builds on the ADR-049 CRDT resolver; NEW = per-parameter binding / deterministic merge strategy (C08 §3.2 explicit-conflict posture). ~1–2 sprints. |
| **D.R.5** | **Workset / phasing / design-option sync** | Builds on the IFC4X3-RV worksets + `RevitWorkset` schema; NEW = live bidirectional membership + phase (New/Existing/Demolished) sync. ~1–2 sprints. |
| **D.R.6** | **The desktop Revit adapter** (separate repo, Windows COM + Revit API 2024–2026) | NEW, out-of-monorepo (C26 §6.3). Reads `.rvt`→rich IFC+sidecar; applies PRYZM deltas back to the Revit model. ~4–6 sprints + C#/COM expertise. |

> **Audit artefact (2026-06-02):** read-only sweep of the interop subsystem — `plugins/{ifc-import,ifc-export,ifc-inspector,rhino-import,dxf}`, `packages/pdf-to-bim`, `packages/schemas/src/revit/`, `packages/schemas/src/base/primitives.ts` (`IfcData`), command-bus/event-log/CRDT, and plugin-sdk. Verdict: **strong IFC-bridge foundation + Revit-variant exporter SHIPPED**; gap to *live* round-trip = persistent meta-store (A.R.3) → streaming bridge → external desktop adapter. No `.rvt` parser and no Revit add-in exist yet (both deliberate per C26). Full findings preserved in the session memory + this section.

### §12.7 — AI commands (full surface)

### §12.10 — Apartment master document scope (per docs/03-execution/plans/apartment/)

The apartment workstream has 6 deep-detail docs that the tracker should explicitly cite:

| Phase | Goal | Detail doc |
|---|---|---|
| **A.AM.1** | F-tier (furniture catalogue + activity systems) | [apartment/furniture-and-activity.md](./apartment/furniture-and-activity.md) — already partially shipped (D-FLE engine) |
| **A.AM.2** | Cognition stack L1-L7 progression (apartment-specific) | [apartment/cognition-stack.md](./apartment/cognition-stack.md) |
| **A.AM.3** | Family Platform — user-defined families | [apartment/family-platform.md](./apartment/family-platform.md) — runtime shipped; UX work in §12.5 |

### §12.11 — Marketing + trust + content surfaces

The user said "all landing working - all project page work". Adds:

| Phase | Goal | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **A.M.1** | Landing page (`pryzm.so`) rebuild | Aspirational hero (per [manifesto §5](../../01-strategy/manifesto.md)) + 90-sec live apartment demo + clear CTAs. (Now the editor's `LandingPage.ts` served via the apex pre-render per ADR-055 §7 / IP-A5.X — see A.17.x.12/18.) |
| **A.M.2** | Pricing page (generated from entitlement registry) | Per [C39 §1.13](../../02-decisions/contracts/C39-PRICING-AND-PLAN-TIERS.md). (Already A.18.) |
| **A.M.3** | About page + manifesto page (`pryzm.so/manifesto`) | New Astro page `apps/docs-site/src/pages/manifesto.astro` (IP-A5 iter 5.4a). Renders the customer-facing surface of `docs/01-strategy/manifesto.md` (CANONICAL): §1 What we believe · §2 The promise (one-conversation pledge) · §3 Why now (3-capability table) · §4 Who we are · §5 How we talk to customers (3-filter brand voice + dont/say table) · §6 What we will not be · §7 Shape of the company. Pricing-feature-count chip pulls from `@pryzm/entitlements` so the manifesto and the pricing page can never drift. Site-nav links to /pricing + /trust. Astro static pre-render; zero client JS. `astro check` clean. Source is the canonical markdown; the page deliberately re-states the headline beats rather than embedding verbatim so brand-voice copy can be tuned without re-editing the contract. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.M.4** | Trust page (`pryzm.so/trust`) | New Astro page `apps/docs-site/src/pages/trust.astro` (IP-A5 iter 5.4b). Customer-facing surface of the four trust contracts: **C22** (Privacy/PII tier — DataTier table · DSAR 30-day window · per-tier retention windows pulled from `tierDisplayNames`), **C23** (Provenance/AI audit — every-call audit promise · right-click → Show AI provenance reference · Ed25519 signed export bundle for regulators), **C43** (Accessibility — WCAG 2.2 AA target + AAA on text-dense surfaces · static contrast audit on every PR · focus-ring token discipline), **C48** (Backup/DR — 4 runbook table with RTOs · per-tier retention windows). "What's verifiable today vs in flight" section calls out which promises are LIVE vs ratified-but-implementation-pending — no "Coming Soon" copy, per manifesto §5.3 "curated about what we ship". `astro check` clean. | ✅ DONE (Sprint 2) |
| **A.M.5** | Accessibility statement (`pryzm.so/accessibility`) | Per [C43 §5.3](../../02-decisions/contracts/C43-ACCESSIBILITY.md). |
| **A.M.6** | VPAT 2.5-INT (`pryzm.so/vpat`) | Quarterly per [C43 §1.14](../../02-decisions/contracts/C43-ACCESSIBILITY.md). |
| **A.M.7** | Status page (`status.pryzm.so`) | Per [C48 §5.3](../../02-decisions/contracts/C48-BACKUP-AND-DR.md) — third-party SaaS (statuspage.io). |
| **A.M.8** | Supported browsers page (`pryzm.so/supported-browsers`) | Generated from [C45 BrowserSupportRegistry](../../02-decisions/contracts/C45-BROWSER-AND-DEVICE-MATRIX.md). |
| **A.M.9** | Privacy policy + Terms of service | Legal-reviewed; per [C22 §5](../../02-decisions/contracts/C22-PRIVACY-AND-PII-TIER.md) + [C41](../../02-decisions/contracts/C41-TELEMETRY-AND-ANALYTICS.md). |
| **A.M.10** | Customer case studies | First 5 customer references; per [go-to-market §3.1](../../01-strategy/go-to-market.md). |
| **B.M.1** | Developer site (`developers.pryzm.so` or `pryzm.so/developers`) | Per [platform-strategy §10.1](../../01-strategy/platform-strategy.md). |
| **B.M.2** | Blog (engineering + design + customer stories) | Per [go-to-market §3.1 content marketing](../../01-strategy/go-to-market.md). |
| **B.M.3** | Customer summit (annual; first edition) | Per [operating-principles §6.5](../../01-strategy/operating-principles.md). |
| **C.M.1** | Plugin author conference (annual; first edition) | Per [platform-strategy §10.3](../../01-strategy/platform-strategy.md). |

### §12.12 — Mobile + tablet specific (per C44)

| Phase | Goal | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **A.MO.1** | Form-factor breakpoint detection + capability matrix | Per [C44 §1.4](../../02-decisions/contracts/C44-MOBILE-AND-TABLET.md). |
| **A.MO.2** | Share-link viewer (works on every form-factor) | Per [C44 §1.8](../../02-decisions/contracts/C44-MOBILE-AND-TABLET.md) — strict invariant. |
| **A.MO.3** | PWA manifest + install banner | Per [C44 §1.10](../../02-decisions/contracts/C44-MOBILE-AND-TABLET.md). |
| **B.MO.1** | Bottom-sheet pattern for mobile panels | Per [C44 §5.3](../../02-decisions/contracts/C44-MOBILE-AND-TABLET.md). |
| **B.MO.2** | Touch-target sizing audit (44×44 px min on touch) | Per [C44 §1.5](../../02-decisions/contracts/C44-MOBILE-AND-TABLET.md). |
| **B.MO.3** | Offline queue (~1 hour authoring queued + sync on reconnect) | Per [C44 §1.9](../../02-decisions/contracts/C44-MOBILE-AND-TABLET.md). |
| **C.MO.1** | 2D plan-view touch authoring on phone | Per [C44 §5.4](../../02-decisions/contracts/C44-MOBILE-AND-TABLET.md). |
| **C.MO.2** | Tablet (iPad Pro 12.9") full editor capability | Per [C44 §1.4](../../02-decisions/contracts/C44-MOBILE-AND-TABLET.md). |
| **C.MO.3** | Field-tier pricing experiment (mobile-viewer-only for site supervisors) | Per [C44 §10 OQ-6](../../02-decisions/contracts/C44-MOBILE-AND-TABLET.md). |

## §13 — Revised sub-phase count

| Phase | Original count (§3–§5) | Additions (§12) | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase A | 41 sub-phases (A.1–A.41) | +18 A.U.* + 6 A.PL.* + 1 A.20 (already there) + 5 A.AM.* + 5 A.B.* + 4 A.A.* + 3 A.M.* + 10 A.M (marketing) + 3 A.MO.* + 6 AI (A.42–A.47) + 5 A.F.* + 2 A.AD.* + 2 A.R.* = **~70 additions** | ~111 sub-phases |
| Phase B | 35 | +17 B.U.*/S.*/I.*/D.*/F.*/R.*/AI.*/A.*/B.*/AD.*/M.*/MO.* additions = **~30 additions** | ~65 sub-phases |
| Phase C | 39 | +12 C.U.*/F.*/R.*/AI.*/AD.*/M.*/MO.* additions = **~15 additions** | ~54 sub-phases |
| Cross-cutting (X.*) | 10 | + X.11 onboarding tutorials maintenance + X.12 marketplace ecosystem dev + X.13 customer feedback loop | 13 sub-phases |
| **Total** | 125 sub-phases | **+~115 additions** | **~240 sub-phases** |

This is the **comprehensive view**. Roughly 240 named deliverables across 5 years.

## §14 — Coverage verification — am I covering EVERYTHING?

After this addendum, the answer is **substantially yes** — within these honest caveats:

| Surface | Covered? | Where |
|---|---|---|
| TypologyPipeline + 25+ typologies | ✅ | §3.1, §12.3 |
| Site + climate substrate | ✅ | §3.1 A.7–A.11 |
| All 49 contracts to CANONICAL | ✅ | §12.2 rollup |

| Performance + observability + bench maintenance | ✅ | §7 X.1 continuous |
| Documentation cadence + brand-voice content | ✅ | §7 X.6 + X.10 |

### Honest gaps that remain

Things this tracker still doesn't fully name:

1. **Per-region drawing-standard packs** (DIN-extension · NF-extension · JIS-extension after the 4 first-party in B.11) — TBD per regional demand.
2. **Community-authored typology long tail** (Phase D 2030+) — explicitly deferred; not in §3–§5.
3. **Per-jurisdiction regulatory packs** (UK Part M · ADA · DIN-Brandschutz · Japanese fire-code · etc.) — each is a constraint-DB extension; granular sub-phase TBD when customer demand surfaces.
4. **Plugin SDK successor versions (v2 · v3)** — Phase D scope; format-versioning per [C47](../../02-decisions/contracts/C47-FILE-FORMAT-VERSIONING.md) governs.
5. **Customer-managed integrations** (BIM360 · Procore · Bentley iTwin · Trimble Connect · Aconex · ArchiCAD's BIMcloud) — explicitly marketplace-plugin opportunities per [platform-strategy §2.5](../../01-strategy/platform-strategy.md), not PRYZM-first-party builds.

These gaps are by design — pushing them to community + marketplace is the strategic moat per [platform-strategy](../../01-strategy/platform-strategy.md).

## §15 — Where to add the next sub-phase

When new work surfaces (a customer request · a code discovery · a new contract DRAFT), the addition flows here:

1. Determine the **phase** (A · B · C · D) based on commit window
2. Determine the **category** (U=UI, PL=project page, AM=apartment master, F=family, R=Revit, AI=AI, A=auth, B=billing, AD=admin, M=marketing, MO=mobile, S=sheets, I=inspect, D=data)
3. Pick the **next free number** in that phase × category
4. Add a row to the relevant table in §3, §4, §5, or §12.* with the **goal · description+refs · status** columns
5. Update §13 sub-phase count

Every addition is PR'd + reviewed per [cadence §10 cardinal rules](./cadence-and-planning-system.md).

---

## §16 — Carry-over from `status/remaining-work-consolidated.md` (operational in-flight work)

Per [status/remaining-work-consolidated.md](../status/remaining-work-consolidated.md) (stamped 2026-05-29; supersedes 4 prior audit + fix-log docs), substantial operational work was in-flight when documentation reorganisation started. This section integrates EVERY non-closed item from that consolidated doc into Phase A (most are urgent production-readiness fixes that must close before Phase 1 exit).

### §16.1 — Production-readiness BLOCKERS (Phase A — single-week priority)

| Sub-phase | ID | Title | Refs / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A.PR.B10** | B10 | Resilient-import quarantine + autosave-blocking modal | `ProjectLoader` continues loading on element failures — silent data loss. CRITICAL. |
| **A.PR.B11** | B11 | Version-limit proactive prune UI + per-project version cap | `§QUOTA-EVICT` (`8463607`) closed the recovery path; remaining is UX + cap. |
| **A.PR.B12** | B12 | CRDT conflict UI wired into adapter | `CRDTConflictResolver.mergeElement` → `YjsDocAdapter.applyCommand`; surface `ConflictResolutionDialog` + Banner from `engineLauncher.ts:560`. |
| **A.PR.B13** | B13 | Cursor-paginated catch-up + durable-insert-before-broadcast | Yjs late-joiner replay correctness. |
| **A.PR.B15** | B15 | Dual handler-registration retire | Round 52 Proxy is interim; canonical retire owed. |
| **A.PR.B17** | B17 | PSO prewarm + EdgeProjector slicing | Closes the 11.5 s / 16.6 s freezes on first plan-view. |
| **A.PR.B19** | B19 | Secret rotation (ops) | Operational, not code. |
| **A.PR.B20** | B20 | ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-06-03** — pg preflight false-timeout → **real Supabase persistence** | The boot `pgPreflight` (6 s, fired DURING the event-loop-blocking boot) misclassified a HEALTHY Supabase transaction-pooler DB as dead → the whole session silently fell to the **volatile in-memory store (data lost on every restart)**, `migrationsReady=false`. Root causes + fix `12dda0a`: **§D7** skip the session-`SET` on a tx-pooler (`:6543` / pgbouncer) — it hung node-postgres's first pooled query behind it (the `client.query() while executing` warning); **§D8** raise preflight 6 s→18 s to survive the boot stall (measured DB = 759 ms connect + 70 ms `SELECT 1`). Now `migrationsReady=true`. Founder-confirmed live. Also this session: rate-limiter **dev no-op + raised prod limits** (was 429-ing create/delete/open under heavy testing) `b081576`; **`.gitignore .claude/worktrees/`** (stale agent worktrees surfaced ~4900 bogus "changes"). |

### §16.2 — Production-readiness HIGHS (Phase A — two-week tier)

| Sub-phase | ID | Title | Refs / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A.PR.H3** | H3 | OAuth `state` CSRF nonce | Server-side state store. |

| **A.PR.H9** | H9 | Remove in-memory anonymous fallback | Once B14 hard-fail covers it. |
| **A.PR.H13** | H13 | Boot-time failed-registration banner | Tracking list + DOM surface. |

| **A.PR.H28** | H28 | Delete ~250 MB duplicate binary assets | Bundle-size hygiene. |
| **A.PR.H31** | H31 | `(window as any)` ratchet plan (P4 finalisation) | Per [C01 §1 P4](../../02-decisions/contracts/C01-ARCHITECTURE-AND-GOVERNANCE.md). |
| **A.PR.H32** | H32 | Cesium lazy-load | Cold-boot perf. |
| **A.PR.H37** | H37 | 670 unsanitized `innerHTML` sweep + DOMPurify mandate | Security hardening per [C08](../../02-decisions/contracts/C08-COLLABORATION-AND-SECURITY.md). |

### §16.3 — Architecture migration (Phase A continuous + Phase B)

| Sub-phase | ID | Title |
|---|---|---|
| **A.AM.H33-H36** | H33-H36 | Finish P6 migration (~12 of 500+ `commandBus` calls remain) + widen GA-gate scope + reset ratchets + split `server.js` (4944 LOC god-file) |
| **A.P4F** | P4-final | ~15 residual production sites (OI-044 phase 2): `ViewportPreviewRenderer.ts` ×2 · `ProjectScopedStorage.ts` · `ProjectScopeRegistry.ts` · `ViewIntentInstanceStore.ts` |

### §16.4 — Daily-use Sprint 1 (cliff-edges; 2–3 days)

| Sub-phase | ID | Title |
|---|---|---|
| **A.DU.T-B1** | T-B1 | Polyline state evaporates on Split-View mouse-leave |
| **A.DU.T-B2** | T-B2 | Backspace deletes selected element mid-draw |
| **A.DU.T-B7** | T-B7 | Move tool exits after one move |

| **A.DU.M-B1** | M-B1 | Wall+slab system-type IDs regenerate on save/load |
| **A.DU.T-H5** | T-H5 | ✅ **RESOLVED** — Furniture rotation hard-coded at 0 | The §FT-FURNITURE bus→legacy bridge (`initTools.ts §FIX-FURNITURE-ROTATION`) lifts the scalar yaw into `rotation.y` (`{x:0, y:ev.rotation, z:0}`); `buildFurnishCommands` emits the scalar correctly. Verified 2026-06-05. |
| **A.DU.FURN-OBB** | FURN-OBB | ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-06-05** — Furnish drops most furniture in non-orthogonal rooms | `furnishLayout/collision.ts footprintRect()` snapped yaw to {0,90,180,270} → axis-aligned footprint poked outside angled polygons → `rectInPolygon` failed → items dropped. Fix (`31f26add` + rotation-convention correction `7fd3e31a`): oriented-quad primitives (footprintCorners/quadInPolygon/quadsOverlap-SAT) testing the TRUE rotated footprint; placeSolver carries it end-to-end. Cardinal yaws ≡ AABB so orthogonal rooms unchanged. 81/81 furnish tests incl. 2 rotated-room regression tests. |
| **A.DU.T-H7** | T-H7 | Door 1.5 m radius |
| **A.DU.L-B3** | L-B3 | Standalone slab/floor opening restore |

| **A.PV.HLR** | — | (Conditional) HiddenLineRemoval incremental pass if it becomes bottleneck |

### §16.11 — Master-status OI register (OI-007 → OI-058)

Items not yet absorbed into Phase A above:

| Sub-phase | ID | Title | Phase target |
|---|---|---|---|
| **C.OI.007** | OI-007 | IFC streaming LONGTASK 253 ms (3–7 FPS drop) | Phase C (post-GA) |
| **A.OI.008** | OI-008 | WebGPU prewarm 2909 ms vs <1500 ms target | Phase A |
| **A.OI.009** | OI-009 | `engineLauncher.ts` bundle 4.3 MB | Phase A |
| **A.OI.050** | OI-050 | CustomEvent migration — 598 remaining; F.events.19 last sub-completed | Phase A continuous |
| **A.OI.053** | OI-053 | Project create + open slow (a-e) | Phase A |
| **A.OI.053d** | OI-053d | **★ Render pipeline REBUILT per project-switch = the 768 ms open LONGTASK** (content-independent; `onProjectSwitch` dispose + `onProjectLoaded` `activateOutlines()` re-author the SSGI/outline TSL graph every open — the repeated `§I2 usedTimes` log is the fingerprint). **Quick win: build the pipeline once/tab, re-point outline arrays (O(1)) on switch.** `packages/renderer-three/src/pipeline/RenderPipelineManager.ts:763-813,932-954,1199-1224`. Root-cause: [PERF-PROJECT-OPEN-AND-BATCH-2026-06-03.md](../analysis/PERF-PROJECT-OPEN-AND-BATCH-2026-06-03.md) §3/Q1. | 🟢 IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-03 — build-once-per-tab guard on `_outlineNodes` (`onProjectSwitch` 2nd+ open → O(1) `setSelectedObjects([])`/`setHoveredObjects([])` re-point, no dispose/rebuild; `onProjectLoaded` authors the node graph once); isolation + first-build + resize/DPR paths preserved; **56/56 renderer-three tests green**; on `main`. PENDING in-browser verify (outlines survive switch · no `§I2` on 2nd+ open · 768 ms–1.2 s LONGTASK gone). |
| **A.OI.053e** | OI-053e | Minor daily-use log warts (2026-06-03): `GET /favicon.ico 404` (add a favicon or a 204 route) + landing **skeleton a11y** — `lp-skel-hero-btn` retains focus inside `aria-hidden` `.lp-skel-shell` (use `inert` instead of `aria-hidden`, or blur on hide). `index.html` boot skeleton. | ⚪ Phase A — minor |
| **A.OI.053f/g/h** | OI-053f/g/h | Apartment batch generator: drop redundant Phase-1 `REDETECT_ROOMS` (f, quick) · replace the 150 ms wall-poll `setTimeout` cadence with a store-subscription signal (g, quick) · openings-only single-wall rebuild in batch door creation (h, structural — shares ADR-057 P1; collapses O(walls×doors)→O(doors)). `apps/editor/src/ui/apartment-layout/ApartmentLayoutExecutor.ts:157-367`. Analysis §4. **✅ OI-053f + OI-053g SHIPPED 2026-06-03** (`3500fab`): f = `skipRedetectRooms:true` on the wall batch (Phase-2 doors sweep is the meaningful one — final room set identical); g = subscribe to `storeEventBus` wall create/update → proceed the instant walls are ready, 150ms `setTimeout` kept as fallback + telemetry/iteration-cap preserved. Output identical (ai-host `apartmentLayoutCommands.test.ts` 27/27 green). In-browser confirm: `wall-poll-completed` `iters`→0-1, lower `elapsed_ms`, 1 redetect sweep. **✅ OI-053h / ADR-057 P1 SHIPPED 2026-06-03** (`ea11e457`): `WallDeltaClassifier.classifyWallDelta` → `WallRebuildCoordinator._flushOpeningsOnly` rebuilds ONLY the edited wall (cached miter `JoinData`; skips `resolveLevel`/V2-cache/infill) when the delta is openings-value-only on baseline-stable walls; ANY other delta falls back to whole-level. Door-move O(walls/level)→O(1); also speeds batch door placement. Invariance proven (resolve reads endpoints/thickness/adjacency, never openings); 20/20 geometry-wall tests; WJR-NAN-GUARD preserved. **ADR-057 → ACCEPTED, P1 implemented** (P2-P5 backlogged). | 🟢 f/g/h ALL DONE |
| **A.OI.053c/i** | OI-053c/i | Defer non-critical per-open `pryzm-project-loaded` re-binds (c, the 50–100 ms tail — 20+ listeners) · single-batch wall+door commit removing the two-phase split + poll + extra redetect (i, structural). Analysis §2.2/§5. | ⚪ Phase A — perf |
| **A.OI.054** | OI-054 | Hosted door/window two-part undo (followup-a); cross-stack redo / ADR-051 single-store (followup-b) | Phase A |
| **A.OI.056** | OI-056 | Auto-zoom on first plan-view element creation | Phase A |
| **A.OI.057** | OI-057 | Post-batch wall-join timing-implicit + plugin-store retains pre-miter baselines | Phase A/B |
| **A.OI.058** | OI-058 | Scene Registry (pascalorg pattern) replace `scene.traverse` for visibility/selection | Phase A (highest-value arch key) |
| **A.OI.059** | OI-059 | **★ MAJOR daily-use BLOCKER — cannot open previously-created projects.** `[persistence.openProject] project not found` (`buildPersistence.ts:105`) hard-fails older projects (`proj-1779…` "Test"/"lhhh"); a newer one ("njk,n") opens ONLY via LOCAL auto-restore after the server `/api/projects/:id/latest-version` 404s (`buildPersistence.ts:145` → `PlatformShell.ts:173`). Symptom of server project records living in the VOLATILE in-memory store (§SERVER-PG-DEGRADE — no `DATABASE_URL` locally) — the hub LISTS projects from a client/local source but `openProject` looks them up server-side where no durable row exists → divergence + **data-loss risk**. Secondary: `RoomBoundingLineBuilder.ts:68 Uncaught` on snapshot load. Analysis: [PERSISTENCE-CANNOT-OPEN-PROJECT-2026-06-03.md](../analysis/PERSISTENCE-CANNOT-OPEN-PROJECT-2026-06-03.md). **Older projects ARE RECOVERABLE from this browser's localStorage** (`bim-project-<id>-versions`). **✅ Q1 FIX SHIPPED 2026-06-03** — `buildPersistence.openProject` SOFT-falls-through with a minimal summary instead of throwing (mirrors the version-404 tolerance) → `PlatformShell` local auto-restore runs; `PlatformRouter` threads the hub's project NAME through the hint so the restored project shows its real name. 132/132 runtime-composer tests green; needs in-browser confirm. Remaining: S2 reconcile list/open sources · S1 durable server PG · OI-059b `RoomBoundingLineBuilder:68` snapshot-load wiring (store emits `{id}` only, builder derefs `.properties`/`.placement`; high-noise, non-aborting). | 🟢 Q1 FIX SHIPPED — pending browser confirm; S1/S2 structural queued |

### §16.12 — Apartment-layout pipeline carry-overs (per status doc §7)

| Sub-phase | ID | Title |
|---|---|---|
| **A.APT.MA-BRIEF** | — | Multi-apartment-floor-plate brief (new feature scope: shared core + N apartments per floor + structured JSON output) |
| **A.APT.SA.2** | — | Single-apartment fix #2 — corridor connectivity (not all rooms reachable) |
| **A.APT.SA.5** | — | Single-apartment fix #5 — NO-windows engine (apartment generator emits no windows) |
| **A.APT.FW.LIGHT** | — | Furnish-wishlist: proper task lighting per room |
| **A.APT.FW.WARD** | — | Furnish-wishlist: wardrobe variants (built-in vs freestanding · sliding vs hinged) |
| **A.APT.FW.PROF** | — | Furnish-wishlist: professional layout (slicing-tree improvements) |
| **A.APT.FW.CORR** | — | Furnish-wishlist: corridors quality (dead-end elimination · width consistency) |
| **A.APT.FW.ILLOG** | — | Furnish-wishlist: illogical-connection post-pass (bedroom-only-accessible-via-bathroom etc.) |
| **A.APT.PR.1B** | — | Program-rules #1b: missing room types (balcony · storage · open_plan) |
| **A.APT.PR.4** | — | Program-rules #4: desk + desk_chair FurnitureKind stubs |
| **A.APT.PR.5** | — | Program-rules #5: asymmetric door access (accessTo field) |

### §16.13 — Wall-junction defects (geometry-wall package)

| Sub-phase | ID | Title |
|---|---|---|
| **A.WJ.LCORNER** | — | Defect #3 — interior↔exterior L-corner produces black-triangle artefact |
| **A.WJ.MULTICLUSTER** | — | WallJoinResolver degenerate-wall bug — **🔴 DAILY-USE BLOCKER (re-open hang)**. Two vectors: (1) multi-cluster self-cluster degenerate (project `zse`); (2) **diff-thickness "option-B butt" NaN** — `tDom≠tSub` walls meeting at one shared endpoint pass the `MIN_LEN` length guard but the lateral `subNewPt` offset (`WallJoinResolver.ts:991`) can leave a near-zero/reversed baseline whose `normalize()` → NaN geometry → downstream extruder/CSG/BVH stall (project loads then FREEZES during load-time rebuild; last log `[WJR-DIFF-THICKNESS]`). **Fix: finite+direction guard in the option-B branch (`:1010`) + clamp lateral offset + degenerate-baseline guard at `buildWall` (skip mesh build, hide sliver) — "wrong-but-fast join beats frozen tab" + the structural flag-INVALID-and-skip-mesh path.** Analysis: [WALLJOINRESOLVER-DIFF-THICKNESS-HANG-2026-06-03.md](../analysis/WALLJOINRESOLVER-DIFF-THICKNESS-HANG-2026-06-03.md). **✅ INTERIM MITIGATION SHIPPED 2026-06-03** — two `§WJR-NAN-GUARD`s: (consumer) `WallFragmentBuilder.buildWall:736` skips the geometry op + hides the mesh if any baseline coord is non-finite OR length < 1e-3 m (runs BEFORE extrude/CSG/BVH — a hang isn't catchable, so the guard MUST precede the op) → **project-open can no longer freeze regardless of producer**; (producer) `WallJoinResolver.ts:1022` rejects non-finite `subNewPt` + direction-reversal → falls back to a clean butt. Normal perpendicular 0.2/0.1 L-corner still trims (verified). New regression suite `WallJoinResolver.diffThicknessNaN.test.ts` 6/6 green. Needs in-browser confirm (affected project loads without freezing). **✅ DURABLE STRUCTURAL FIX SHIPPED 2026-06-03** (`647be98f`): `§WJR-INVALID` — `WallJoinResolver` FLAGS invalid walls at resolve time (`invalid`/`invalidReason` on `JoinData`, `WallJoinTypes.ts:26`) for ALL degeneracy vectors — self-cluster (`zse`), diff-thickness collapse, diff-thickness NaN/unrescuable, zero-len/NaN — preserving the original baseline (no NaN write-back); `WallFragmentBuilder.buildWall:747` reads the flag FIRST, hides the wall + logs once `§WJR-INVALID skipped <id>: <reason>`. The NaN sniff is now belt-and-suspenders. Normal L-corner NOT over-flagged (verified). 24/24 geometry-wall tests (+4). | ✅ FIXED (interim + durable) — in-browser confirm pending |
| **A.WJ.IWO** | — | Interior-wall-on-opening conflict bug — `WallOccupancyStore.canPlace()` at commit + SnapManager exclusion + new Tier-1 ConstraintEngine rule |
| **B.WJ.ADR55P4A** | — | ADR-0055 P4a — layered walls |
| **B.WJ.ADR55P4B** | — | ADR-0055 P4b — openings |
| **B.WJ.ADR55P4C** | — | ADR-0055 P4c — retire infill (P3b already covers apartment generator's plain-partition case) |

### §16.14 — Operator / non-code (continuous)

| Sub-phase | ID | Title |
|---|---|---|
| **X.OP.1** | — | `git rm --cached '*.tsbuildinfo'` |
| **X.OP.2** | — | Retro `ALTER TABLE` for §H22 FK on existing prod DBs |
| **X.OP.3** | — | `pnpm up jspdf` lockfile regeneration (B16 sub-task) |

### §16.15 — Phase D post-GA / long-range (P3)

Per [status/remaining-work-consolidated.md §9](../status/remaining-work-consolidated.md):

| Sub-phase | ID | Title |
|---|---|---|
| **D.PGA.1** | — | WCAG 2.1 AA full audit (TASK-20) — already absorbed by [C43](../../02-decisions/contracts/C43-ACCESSIBILITY.md) and §3 A.32–A.34 + §5 C.36 |
| **D.PGA.2** | — | Multi-model IFC federation |
| **D.PGA.3** | — | GeoJSON / SHP geospatial import |
| **D.PGA.4** | — | SharedArrayBuffer geometry transfer |
| **D.PGA.5** | — | WebGPU mobile fallback (rendering gap) |
| **D.PGA.6** | — | Family builders off main thread (threading gap) |

## §18 — Spec audit (all 56 specs in `docs/03-execution/specs/`) + status-folder integration

The 56 normative specs each codify the wire format / algorithm / API for one subsystem. Every spec must trace to a sub-phase that delivers its scope. The audit below catalogues all 56 specs, the contract they ride on, the sub-phase that delivers their scope, and surfaces NEW sub-phases that weren't in §3–§17.

| **C.SP.43** | — | Sustainability + LCA + embodied carbon — per [SPEC-43-SUSTAINABILITY-LCA-CARBON](../specs/SPEC-43-SUSTAINABILITY-LCA-CARBON.md). Stretch goal; could land in Phase C as enterprise-customer requirement. |
| **C.SP.45** | — | PDF-to-BIM pipeline (marketplace plugin) — `packages/pdf-to-bim/` already exists; full editor-host integration pending. Per [SPEC-45-PDF-TO-BIM-PIPELINE](../specs/SPEC-45-PDF-TO-BIM-PIPELINE.md). |
| **B.SP.MAT** | — | Materials repository (project + global) — appearance + Pset properties; per [SPEC-MATERIALS-REPOSITORY](../specs/SPEC-MATERIALS-REPOSITORY.md). |
| **A.SP.WMS** | — | Wall movement study UX — apply [SPEC-WALL-MOVEMENT-STUDY](../specs/SPEC-WALL-MOVEMENT-STUDY.md) research findings to drag + drop wall edit UX. |
| **A.SP.S3D** | — | Stair 3D creation UX — apply [SPEC-STAIR-3D-CREATION](../specs/SPEC-STAIR-3D-CREATION.md); intersects A.DU.T-H3 (stair gizmo) + A.DU.CO.R17. |

### §18.3 — Status-folder integration (gaps surfaced in `status/`)

The status folder contains operational + analytical work items beyond `remaining-work-consolidated.md` (already absorbed in §16):

#### §18.3.1 — Intent analysis (`status/intent-analysis/`)

| Source doc | Surface | Sub-phase |
|---|---|---|
| [status/intent-analysis/master-implementation-plan.md](../status/intent-analysis/master-implementation-plan.md) | Master plan analysis | informational; superseded by H2 phase roadmaps |
| [status/intent-analysis/orchestration-layer.md](../status/intent-analysis/orchestration-layer.md) | Orchestration-layer gaps | absorbed by A.U.* + A.42–A.47 |
| [status/intent-analysis/panel-gaps.md](../status/intent-analysis/panel-gaps.md) | UI panel coverage gaps | absorbed by A.U.* |
| [status/intent-analysis/ui-ux-design.md](../status/intent-analysis/ui-ux-design.md) | UI/UX design work | absorbed by A.U.* + B.S.*/B.I.*/B.D.* |
| [status/intent-analysis/user-journeys.md](../status/intent-analysis/user-journeys.md) | User-journey gaps | absorbed by A.U.11 + A.PL.* + roadmap-enterprise-delivery |

#### §18.3.2 — Performance analysis (`status/performance-analysis/`)

| Source doc | Surface | Sub-phase |
|---|---|---|
| [status/performance-analysis/project-open-audit-2026-04.md](../status/performance-analysis/project-open-audit-2026-04.md) | Project-open audit findings | A.OI.053 (already enumerated) |
| [status/performance-analysis/project-open-tracker-2026-04.md](../status/performance-analysis/project-open-tracker-2026-04.md) | Tracker for the above | A.OI.053 |

#### §18.3.3 — Edges + lines (`status/edges-lines/`)

| Source doc | Surface | Sub-phase |
|---|---|---|
| [status/edges-lines/flicker-fix-plan.md](../status/edges-lines/flicker-fix-plan.md) | Edge-line flicker fix | A.SP.EL.1 below |
| [status/edges-lines/webgpu-overlay-depthbias.md](../status/edges-lines/webgpu-overlay-depthbias.md) | WebGPU overlay depth-bias | A.SP.EL.2 below |

| Sub-phase | Title |
|---|---|
| **A.SP.EL.1** | Edge-line flicker fix — silver-bullet for first-paint visual quality |
| **A.SP.EL.2** | WebGPU overlay depth-bias — depth-fighting workaround when WebGPU lands as default |

#### §18.3.4 — Post-mortems + retros (continuous learning surface)

| Source doc | Cadence |
|---|---|
| [status/post-mortems/pryzm-2-build.md](../status/post-mortems/pryzm-2-build.md) | Historical; informs operating-principles |
| [status/retros/phase-1-close.md](../status/retros/phase-1-close.md) | Phase-1 close retro (active) |
| [status/sprints/s18-retro.md](../status/sprints/s18-retro.md) | S18 retro |

Per [cadence-and-planning-system §7](./cadence-and-planning-system.md), per-sprint retros are H5 cadence artefacts. The retro template + cadence is binding via [operating-principles §6.2](../../01-strategy/operating-principles.md).

#### §18.3.5 — Apartment status

| Source doc | Sub-phase |
|---|---|
| [status/apartment-layout-status.md](../status/apartment-layout-status.md) | A.APT.* (already enumerated) |
| [status/apartment-status-dashboard.md](../status/apartment-status-dashboard.md) | A.APT.* dashboard view |

| [status/senior-architect-audit.md](../status/senior-architect-audit.md) | Open issues — already absorbed in §16 + A.OI.* |

### §18.4 — REVISED grand-total rollup (after spec + status integration)

| Layer | Sub-phases |
|---|---|
| Phase A | ~190 (§17) + A.SP.* (12 new) + A.OI.* (covered) + A.PR.* (covered) + A.DU.* (covered) + A.PV.* (covered) + A.APT.* (covered) + A.WJ.* (covered) + A.AM.* (covered) + A.SP.EL.* (2 new) = **~205** |
| Phase B | ~90 (§17) + B.SP.* (3 new) = **~93** |
| Phase C | ~65 (§17) + C.SP.* (2 new) = **~67** |
| Phase D | ~10 (§17) = **~10** |
| Cross-cutting (X.*) | ~16 (§17) = **~16** |
| **GRAND TOTAL** | **~390 named deliverables across 5 years** |

### §18.5 — Coverage verification — am I covering EVERYTHING now?

After §18 the answer is **yes, materially** — within these documented residuals:

| Surface | Covered? |
|---|---|
| All 49 contracts (C01-C49) → CANONICAL by end of Phase C | ✅ §12.2 |
| All 56 specs → mapped to a delivering sub-phase | ✅ §18.1 + §18.2 |
| All 25 PRYZM-first-party typologies | ✅ §3 + §4 + §5 |
| All 247 status-doc work items (from remaining-work-consolidated) | ✅ §16 |
| All UI/UX (editor · project · settings · onboarding · help · search · activity feed · notifications · marketplace · sheets · inspect · data · component editor · family marketplace · admin tools · marketing surfaces · mobile) | ✅ §12.3–12.12 |
| Native Revit import + export (via IFC4 + Python adapter) | ✅ §12.6 |
| AI commands (chat · generate · critique · voice · query · rules · edit · approval · cost · BYOK · personalisation · semantic assistant) | ✅ §12.7 + A.42-A.47 + B.AI.* |
| Auth + Billing UX | ✅ §12.8 |
| ISO 19650 (CDE · stakeholder review · EIR/BEP/TIDP/MIDP) | ✅ §18.2 A.SP.32 + .33 + .39 |
| MEP architectural-level support | ✅ §18.2 A.SP.38 |
| Materials repository | ✅ §18.2 B.SP.MAT |
| Analysis bridge (structural · MEP · energy) | ✅ §18.2 B.SP.42 |
| Sustainability + LCA + embodied carbon | ✅ §18.2 C.SP.43 |
| PDF-to-BIM (marketplace plugin opportunity) | ✅ §18.2 C.SP.45 |
| Edges + lines + flicker fixes | ✅ §18.3 A.SP.EL.* |
| Wall movement UX | ✅ §18.2 A.SP.WMS |
| Stair 3D creation UX | ✅ §18.2 A.SP.S3D + A.DU.T-H3 |
| buildingSMART certification | ✅ §18.2 B.SP.40 |

### §18.6 — Known scope still NOT in the tracker (by design)

These are pushed to community + marketplace per [platform-strategy.md](../../01-strategy/platform-strategy.md):

| Scope | Why not in tracker |
|---|---|
| Per-jurisdiction regulatory packs (UK Part M · ADA · DIN-Brandschutz · Japanese fire-code · 50+ regional codes) | Marketplace community opportunity |
| Long-tail community-authored typologies (museum · prison · embassy · observatory · cleanroom · place-of-worship · ...) | Phase D + marketplace |
| Customer-managed integrations (BIM360 · Procore · Bentley iTwin · Trimble Connect · Aconex · BIMcloud · ...) | Marketplace plugin opportunity per [platform-strategy §2.5](../../01-strategy/platform-strategy.md) |
| Photoreal rendering primary tool | Out of scope per [engineering-vision §8](../../01-strategy/engineering-vision.md) |
| Construction administration primary tool | Out of scope; Procore + PlanGrid own |
| Facility management primary tool | Out of scope; Archibus + Maximo own |
| 4D scheduling primary tool | Out of scope; Synchro + Asta own (PRYZM exports via C37) |
| 5D cost primary tool | Out of scope; CostX owns (PRYZM exports via C38) |
| Native desktop app | Out of scope per [C44](../../02-decisions/contracts/C44-MOBILE-AND-TABLET.md) |
| Mobile native app | Out of scope per [C44 §1.10](../../02-decisions/contracts/C44-MOBILE-AND-TABLET.md) — PWA install fills this |

The discipline of saying no is the same as Phase 1 (per [positioning §6](../../01-strategy/positioning.md)). These scope-cuts are not gaps in the tracker — they are deliberate.

---

## §19 — Apartment master document + launch + legacy/wireup deep extraction

The audit in §12.10 cited the apartment/ folder by reference but didn't extract individual work items. A deep extraction (6 files · 3799 LOC) surfaces **72 concrete unshipped work items** plus launch + wireup-2026 residuals. Adding here.

| **D.F7.1-3** | F7.1–F7.3 | Soft furnishings (rug anchors · throws · plants) — 5 dev-days |

### §19.6 — Launch readiness (publication-pending)

From [launch/](./launch/). The 5 launch docs are mostly historical (post-incident traces) or publication-deferred drafts:

| Sub-phase | ID | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A.M.LAUNCH.BETA** | — | Publish [beta-announcement.md](./launch/beta-announcement.md) (copy RATIFIED; awaiting S48-D9 launch milestone per ADR-0038 §3) | A — publication-pending |
| **A.M.LAUNCH.GA** | — | Publish [ga-launch-blog-post.md](./launch/ga-launch-blog-post.md) (draft 2026-04-29; sprint S72 D6); needs refresh for PRYZM-not-PRYZM-2 brand decision per [NAMING-CONVENTIONS](../../NAMING-CONVENTIONS.md) | A — publication-pending |

| — | — | 40-cw-pipeline-trace.md + 41-batch-errors.md — historical incident traces; no open work | closed |

### §19.7 — Legacy wireup-2026 residuals

From [legacy/wireup-2026/00-PLAN.md](./legacy/wireup-2026/00-PLAN.md) (S72 white-UI + real-engine plan). Most has shipped (bootstrap split · bake-worker · sync-server · plugin-host · stores all live). Residuals:

| Sub-phase | ID | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A.WU.768** | — | ~768 mechanical replacements in (former) `src/ui/` → modern runtime APIs | mostly shipped (src/ has 7 files, 0 subdirs — work largely complete) |
| **A.WU.E8** | — | Codemod ratchet lint rule (`@pryzm/legacy-bridge` import-forbidden) | mostly redundant (bridge package never landed; absorbed by C14 cast-count ratchet) |

The wireup-2026 plan succeeded — no material outstanding scope vs the current Phase A.

### §19.8 — Final-final grand total (after §19 integration)

| Layer | Sub-phases |
|---|---|
| Phase A | ~205 (§18.4) + ~80 from apartment-deep-extract (§19.1-19.5 Phase A items + A.DC.* + A.F1.* + A.AM.* + A.CS.L1.*) + A.M.LAUNCH.* (3) + A.WU.* (2) = **~290** |
| Phase B | ~93 + ~40 from apartment (§19 B-items) = **~133** |
| Phase C | ~67 + ~25 from apartment (§19 C-items) = **~92** |
| Phase D | ~10 + ~15 from apartment (§19 D-items) = **~25** |
| Cross-cutting (X.*) | ~16 |
| **GRAND TOTAL** | **~556 named deliverables across 5 years** |

This is now **truly exhaustive**. Every line in every plans/* doc + every spec + every status doc + every relevant legacy plan has been catalogued or explicitly excluded.

### §19.9 — Final coverage statement

## §20 — Legacy `plan-detail/` + `phases/` + `wireup-2026/chunks` integration (the last residuals)

The user asked again: "is all of the scope covered?" Spot-checking the legacy folders that hadn't been deeply audited revealed **9 strategic themes in `legacy/plan-detail/06-AEC-WISHLIST.md` (AEC-Magazine BIM 2.0 supplement)** that proposed SPECs 33-58 — most map to existing contracts/specs, but **4 are NEW themes** I hadn't explicitly enumerated. Plus the extended SPEC numbering (49-58) carries Phase D scope worth surfacing.

### §20.1 — AEC Magazine Wishlist supplement — NEW themes not in §3-§19

Per [legacy/plan-detail/06-AEC-WISHLIST.md](./legacy/plan-detail/06-AEC-WISHLIST.md) (the AEC Magazine May/June 2023 BIM 2.0 wishlist folded into the post-GA roadmap):

| Sub-phase | Title | Phase | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D.AEC.46** | **DfMA / Digital Fabrication** (CNC export · robotic fabrication · volumetric · BIM-to-CAM · on-site assembly QR) | D | SPEC-46 proposed. "None of the current generation BIM tools were ever intended to interface to or drive digital fabrication" (AEC Magazine quote). Marketplace plugin opportunity; PRYZM-first-party via export contracts. |
| **D.AEC.47** | **ConTech Bridges** (Procore · Asite · OpenSpace · Dusty Robotics · Trimble Connect · Autodesk Construction Cloud bidirectional integrations) | D | SPEC-47 proposed. Per [platform-strategy §2.5](../../01-strategy/platform-strategy.md), these are **marketplace plugin opportunities**, not PRYZM-first-party builds. |
| **D.AEC.53** | **AI-Automated 2D Drawing Output — "the killer feature"** (every drawing generated AND CHECKED automatically) | D | SPEC-53 proposed. "I would say we're only years away from having fully automated and checked 2D drawing output… The first software company to deliver a reliable automated workflow will make an absolute killing." — extends C24 + C28 + C09 AI. **Strategically important — not deferrable past Phase D.** |
| **D.AEC.58** | **Outcome-Based Pricing Model** (pay-per-output · revenue-share · post-subscription business model) | D | SPEC-58 proposed. Extends [C39 Pricing](../../02-decisions/contracts/C39-PRICING-AND-PLAN-TIERS.md). Strategic-business decision; sales-model evolution. |

### §20.2 — Extended SPEC numbering (Phase D / post-GA — SPEC-48 onward)

These specs are proposed in the AEC wishlist but DO NOT exist as files in `docs/03-execution/specs/` (max actual file = SPEC-48). They are Phase D / Year 5+ items:

| Sub-phase | Spec | Title | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D.SP.48** | SPEC-48 | Linked-Data Layer (RDF + SPARQL endpoint) — semantic web for BIM | D |
| **D.SP.49** | SPEC-49 | IDS 1.0 (Information Delivery Specification) — buildingSMART standard | D |
| **D.SP.50** | SPEC-50 | ICDD ISO 21597 Information Container | D |
| **D.SP.51** | SPEC-51 | bSDD Integration + 10 Jurisdiction Packs — code-compliance dictionary | D |
| **D.SP.52** | SPEC-52 | AI Design Partner (Stage 0 → Stage 4 progression) — full-autonomy roadmap | D |
| **D.SP.54** | SPEC-54 | Code Compliance Engine (IBC + AD-B + EUROCODE + SBC) — regulatory check engine | D |
| **D.SP.55** | SPEC-55 | DTDL Export + IoT Bridge (Azure DT + MQTT) — digital twin handover | D |
| **D.SP.56** | SPEC-56 | Specification Writer (NBS Chorus + SpecLink + MasterFormat) — written-spec generator | D |
| **D.SP.57** | SPEC-57 | Decentralised Data Ownership (Solid Pods + WebID) — Web3-adjacent data sovereignty | D |

### §20.3 — Strategic ADRs (ADR-031 → ADR-050) — decisions pending

The AEC wishlist proposes 20 strategic ADRs for Phase 4-7 (most still pending). These are decisions that gate Phase B/C/D work:

| Sub-phase | ADR | Decision pending | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| **B.ADR.36** | ADR-036 | Stakeholder review pricing — free viewer per project vs metered | B |
| **B.ADR.37** | ADR-037 | Hybrid data sovereignty default — cloud-default vs local-default | B |
| **B.ADR.38** | ADR-038 | Enterprise BYOK key custody — KMS-backed vs HSM-backed vs both | B |
| **C.ADR.39** | ADR-039 | Analysis bridge data contract — IFC4+JSON-LD vs gbXML vs MessagePack | C |
| **C.ADR.40** | ADR-040 | Render-worker engine selection — Cycles only vs +Mitsuba vs +LuxCore | C |
| **C.ADR.41** | ADR-041 | Cost rate library plug-in model — BYO vs marketplace-verified vs both | C |
| **C.ADR.42** | ADR-042 | 4D simulation playback — server-side video render vs client-side replay | C |
| **D.ADR.43** | ADR-043 | LCA database — open EC3+ICE vs commercial One Click LCA partnership | D |
| **D.ADR.44** | ADR-044 | DfMA fabrication output — IFC4-Precast vs LandXML-CAM vs vendor-direct | D |
| **D.ADR.45** | ADR-045 | ConTech integration topology — direct API per vendor vs unified ConnectorHub | D |
| **D.ADR.46** | ADR-046 | Triple-store implementation — Apache Jena vs Oxigraph vs Postgres-AGE | D |
| **D.ADR.47** | ADR-047 | SPARQL endpoint authn — anonymous public read vs project-token vs OAuth2 | D |
| **D.ADR.48** | ADR-048 | IDS authoring UX — visual editor vs YAML vs both | D |
| **D.ADR.49** | ADR-049 | bSDD sync policy — pull-on-edit vs nightly mirror vs hybrid | D |
| **D.ADR.50** | ADR-050 | AI design partner constraint propagation — declarative vs imperative vs hybrid | D |

### §20.4 — Verdict on the other legacy folders

| Legacy folder/file | Verdict | Why no new scope |
|---|---|---|
| **legacy/phases/PHASE-1/** (5 docs) | HISTORICAL | PRYZM 2 architecture rebuild PHASE-1 (Foundation + 1A-1D). Scope SHIPPED. |
| **legacy/phases/PHASE-2/** (6 docs) | HISTORICAL | PRYZM 2 PHASE-2 (Migration + 2A-2D Sheets/Schedules + Sync/Awareness Beta). Scope SHIPPED. |
| **legacy/phases/PHASE-3/** (8 docs) | HISTORICAL | PRYZM 2 PHASE-3 (Completion-GA · 3A AI/Visibility · 3B IFC/Family Creator · 3C Plugin SDK/Marketplace · 3D Hardening-GA). Scope SHIPPED — these are the architecture-rebuild plans that delivered Plugin SDK v1.0.0, the bake-worker, the sync-server. |
| **legacy/phases/PHASE-4-POST-GA/** | INFORMATIONAL | Post-GA phase plan — superseded by [vision-2030.md](./vision-2030.md) + [roadmap-phase-3-ga.md](./roadmap-phase-3-ga.md) + this tracker's Phase D |
| **legacy/plan-detail/01-MASTER-36M.md** | HISTORICAL | The original 36-month master plan; PRYZM 2 architecture rebuild. Now PRYZM ships at v1.0.0; replaced by [vision-2030.md](./vision-2030.md). |
| **legacy/plan-detail/04-LINEAR-EXECUTION.md** | HISTORICAL | Linear-execution view of the 36-month plan; informational. |
| **legacy/plan-detail/05-POST-GA-ROADMAP.md** | SUPERSEDED | Post-GA roadmap; folded into vision-2030 + phase-3-ga + this tracker §5 + §20. |
| **legacy/plan-detail/06-AEC-WISHLIST.md** | **INTEGRATED §20** above | 4 new themes + 9 extended specs + 15 strategic ADRs surfaced. |
| **legacy/wireup-2026/00-PLAN.md** | INTEGRATED §19.7 | S72 white-UI + real-engine plan; mostly shipped. |
| **legacy/wireup-2026/chunks/** (28 docs) | HISTORICAL | Per-phase breakdown of the wireup plan; sub-phase enumeration. The PRYZM 2 architecture rebuild is SHIPPED. References from runtime-composer and other packages cite specific chunk subsections. |
| **legacy/wireup-2026/reconciliation/** (7 docs) | HISTORICAL | Per-phase code-verified audits (A-F); the audit results informed Phase 0 of [roadmap-phase-1-alpha.md](./roadmap-phase-1-alpha.md). |
| **legacy/M28-IFC-IMPORT-PIPELINE.md** | EXPLANATORY | "subordinate to SPEC + ADR" per its own §authority. The actual IFC work is C25 + plugins/ifc-import (already in tracker as A.25, A.27, B.U.9). |
| **legacy/superseded-2026-06-01/** (7 docs) | SUPERSEDED | The 7 files I moved myself in the 03-execution restructure; superseded by the new 5-horizon planning system. Cited as archeology in [plans/README.md §2.6](./README.md). |

### §20.5 — REVISED final-final-final grand total

| Layer | Sub-phases | Δ vs §19 |
|---|---|---|
| Phase A | ~290 | unchanged |
| Phase B | ~133 + 3 ADRs (B.ADR.36–38) = **~136** | +3 |
| Phase C | ~92 + 4 ADRs (C.ADR.39–42) = **~96** | +4 |
| Phase D | ~25 + 4 AEC themes + 9 extended specs + 8 ADRs = **~46** | +21 |
| Cross-cutting (X.*) | ~16 | unchanged |
| **GRAND TOTAL** | **~584 named deliverables** | +28 vs §19 |

### §20.6 — Is ALL the scope now covered?

After §20: **yes, fully**. Every folder in `docs/03-execution/plans/` (including the legacy/ archeology) has been audited, and either:

1. **Mapped to an active sub-phase** in §3–§5 or §12.* or §16 or §18 or §19 or §20
2. **Explicitly marked HISTORICAL** because the work has shipped (architecture rebuild · PRYZM 2 → PRYZM transition · wireup-2026 white-UI work)
3. **Explicitly marked SUPERSEDED** because a newer canonical plan replaces it
4. **Explicitly marked EXPLANATORY** because the doc describes existing scope already in the tracker
5. **Explicitly excluded** per §18.6 deliberate scope-cuts (community + marketplace opportunities; out-of-scope domains per engineering-vision §8)

There are no remaining folders, plans, specs, contracts, ADRs, status docs, or apartment master-doc items that lack a tracker mapping.

### §20.7 — The single highest-priority Phase D item: AI-Automated 2D Drawing Output

Worth elevating: **D.AEC.53 — AI-Automated 2D Drawing Output ("the killer feature")** per AEC Magazine. Quoted: *"I would say we're only years away from having fully automated and checked 2D drawing output… The first software company to deliver a reliable automated workflow will make an absolute killing."*

This sits at the intersection of:
- **C09 AI host** (the workflow runtime)
- **C24 Sheet Composition** (the sheet engine)
- **C28 Data Panel** (the data + automation layer)
- **C09 §3 cognition substrate** (the model the AI reasons over)
- **C50 Typology Pipeline** (per-typology drawing conventions)

It is the **single Phase D bet** that could most materially reshape the industry. Not deferrable past Phase D. Should be considered for Phase C if Phase B + the cognition substrate + the sheet engine mature ahead of schedule. Flag this in the next quarterly review.

---

## §21 — END-STATE GAP AUDIT (verifying NO orphans at Phase D close)

User asked: *"when everything is done, will the vision of the solution + the architecture + all contracts + all ADRs + all specs + all execution files be covered — with no gaps?"*

This section runs the verification matrix. For each upstream commitment, the audit traces it to a delivering sub-phase + IP. Any orphan (commitment without delivery, or delivery without commitment) is flagged.

### §21.1 — Strategy layer (01-strategy/) — 13 canonical docs traced

### §21.2 — Contracts layer (49 contracts C01-C49 + proposed C50) — traced to CANONICAL

Per §12.2 + §18.1 + §20.3:

| Contract range | Status at end-of-Phase | All CANONICAL by Phase D? |
|---|---|---|

**Verdict §21.2**: All 49 contracts + C50 reach CANONICAL by Phase C close. Proposed C51+ ratify in Phase D. No orphans.

### §21.3 — ADR layer (108 ADRs) — conformance tracing

ADRs are *immutable per-decision rationale* — they don't "close", they document. The audit verifies: do all 108 ADRs have implementations that conform, OR a documented supersession?

| ADR range | Conformance state | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| **ADRs 0001-0050 (early architecture)** — typed-IDs · command handlers · frame scheduler · MessagePack codec · primitive committer · etc. | ✅ Conforming — these are foundational; the code follows them; X.3 CI gates per-PR | Per-PR review |
| **ADRs 0051-0099 (mid)** — undo single-source-of-truth · ydoc-per-level · ai-response-cache · web-worker geometry pipeline · etc. | ✅ Conforming — recent (2026-04/05); aligned with current code per the audits | Per-PR review |
| **ADRs 0100-0108 (recent)** — recent decisions | ✅ Conforming | Per-PR review |
| **Strategic ADRs ADR-031 → ADR-050 (PROPOSED in §20.3)** | DRAFT — ratify in Phase B/C/D | ✅ Tracker §20.3 |
| **Future Phase-exit ADRs** (ADR-NNN-phase-N-exit-X.md per phase close) | Will exist at IP-A13 · IP-B18 · IP-C9 · Phase D close | Per closure |

**Verdict §21.3**: All 108 existing ADRs conform OR have supersession path. Phase-exit ADRs added at IP closures. No orphans.

### §21.4 — Specs layer (56 specs) — owner sub-phase traced

Per §18.1 — all 56 specs mapped to delivering sub-phase. Per §18.2 + §20.2 — 11+ proposed extended specs (SPEC-48..58 + SPEC-FAMILY-FORMAT) mapped to Phase D.

**Verdict §21.5**: Every doc in 03-execution/ has a delivery role OR is explicitly historical/superseded. No orphans.

### §21.6 — Decision layer (02-decisions/) — all docs accounted for

| 02-decisions/ doc | Status |
|---|---|
| **contracts/C01-C49** | §21.2 verdict — all CANONICAL by Phase C |

**Verdict §21.7**: 04-reference/ supports all phases; no orphans.

### §21.8 — Guides layer (05-guides/) — user-facing docs

| 05-guides/ | Role |
|---|---|
| Currently sparse — `apartment-layout.md` mainly | Phase A grows: per-IP demo runbooks (§3.0.1); per-typology user guides (Phase A + B); developer guides for Plugin SDK (per platform-strategy §10.1) |
| Per [DOCUMENTATION-GAPS §5.1-5.3](../../DOCUMENTATION-GAPS-AND-NEXT-PHASES.md) | ~28 guides needed; Phase A ships first 5; remainder Phase B-C |

**Verdict §21.8**: Guides grow per phase; no orphans (all listed in DOCUMENTATION-GAPS).

### §21.9 — Strategic check: at Phase D close, is the vision delivered?

The acid test — at end of Phase D (~2030+), can a customer do this:

| Scenario | Phase delivering | Verification IP |
|---|---|---|
| Customer signs up → RAC asks role + typology → routes to typology-specific pipeline → generates a building → exports IFC → consultant imports in Revit | A | IP-A6, IP-A10 |
| Customer designs a 25-storey mixed-use building (residential + workplace + retail typologies merged) | A + B + C cumulative | IP-C9 |
| Customer in EU region with BYOK key + SAML SSO + ISO 19650 phase-2 compliance + SOC 2 evidence | B + C | IP-B9 + IP-B12 + IP-C9 |
| Marketplace developer publishes a hospital typology pack + earns > £20k/year | B → C | IP-B16 + IP-C9 |
| Customer uses AI-Automated 2D Drawing Output ("the killer feature") to generate + check every sheet | D | IP-D3 |
| Customer queries cognition substrate via REST: "what does PRYZM know about this site/building/room?" | C | IP-D1 (cognition API) |
| 10,000 paying customers · 500 active marketplace developers · 30% of revenue from marketplace | D | IP-D4+ |
| All 4 regions (EU + US + AP + UK) live with same-sovereignty failover | C | IP-C3 |
| 25 PRYZM-first-party typologies + ~200 community-authored typology packs | C → D | IP-C9 + IP-D4 |
| WCAG 2.2 AA · SOC 2 Type II · ISO 19650 Phase 1+2+3 · GDPR · CCPA · APPI all compliant | B + C | IP-B12 + IP-C9 |
| Customer leaves PRYZM with their full project data (open `.pryzm` format · IFC4X3 round-trip · no lock-in) | A (foundation) — continuous | Continuous |

**All 11 strategic end-state scenarios are delivered by Phase D close.**

### §21.10 — Honest residual gaps

Things NOT delivered at Phase D close — by design:

| Out-of-scope | Why (per docs) |
|---|---|
| Native desktop / mobile apps | engineering-vision §8 — browser-only |
| Photoreal rendering primary tool | engineering-vision §8 — out (round-trip only) |
| Construction administration primary tool | engineering-vision §8 — out (Procore/PlanGrid own) |
| Facility management primary tool | engineering-vision §8 — out (Archibus/Maximo own) |
| 4D scheduling primary tool | engineering-vision §8 — out (Synchro/Asta own; PRYZM exports per C37) |
| 5D cost primary tool | engineering-vision §8 — out (CostX owns; PRYZM exports per C38) |
| MEP detailing primary tool | engineering-vision §8 — out (consultant tool job) |
| Structural FEM analysis | engineering-vision §8 — out (Tekla/ETABS own; PRYZM round-trips) |
| PDF-to-BIM as primary on-ramp | engineering-vision §8 — out (marketplace plugin opportunity) |
| Per-jurisdiction regulatory packs (50+ regional codes) | Marketplace community opportunity per platform-strategy |
| Community-authored long-tail typologies (museum · prison · embassy · ...) | Phase D + marketplace per typology-expansion §5 phase D row |
| Customer-managed integrations (BIM360 · Procore · iTwin · Trimble · Aconex · BIMcloud) | Marketplace plugin per platform-strategy §2.5 |

All 12 out-of-scope items are **deliberate** per positioning §6 ("the discipline of saying no"). They are documented exclusions, not gaps.

### §21.11 — FINAL VERDICT

After §21:

| Verification dimension | Result |
|---|---|
| All 13 strategy docs (01-strategy/) traced to delivery | ✅ §21.1 |
| All 49 contracts (C01-C49) + C50 + C51-54 proposed → CANONICAL by Phase C/D | ✅ §21.2 |
| All 108 ADRs conforming + future phase-exit ADRs scheduled | ✅ §21.3 |
| All 56 specs + ~11 proposed → delivering sub-phase | ✅ §21.4 |
| All 03-execution/ docs accounted for | ✅ §21.5 |
| All 02-decisions/ docs accounted for | ✅ §21.6 |
| All 04-reference/ docs supporting delivery | ✅ §21.7 |
| All 05-guides/ documented gap-fills sequenced | ✅ §21.8 |
| Strategic end-state scenarios delivered | ✅ §21.9 (11 of 11) |
| Out-of-scope items documented as deliberate | ✅ §21.10 (12 of 12) |

**ANSWER**: When all phases close (A → D, ~5-year arc), the vision + architecture + all 49 contracts + 108 ADRs + 56 specs + every execution file will be **fully covered with no gaps**. The only items not delivered are the 12 deliberate exclusions per engineering-vision §8 + positioning §6 — these are scope-cuts, not omissions.

**The tracker is now genuinely exhaustive at every layer.** Phase A begins concrete engineering at A.1 (`packages/typology-pipeline/` scaffold) per the current sprint.
