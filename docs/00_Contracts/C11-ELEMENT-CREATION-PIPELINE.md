# C11 — Element Creation Pipeline

> **Stamp**: 2026-05-03 · **Status**: CANONICAL · **Last amended**: 2026-05-19 (Comprehensive Audit Rev 2)
> **Scope**: The complete end-to-end pipeline for element creation in PRYZM — from user gesture or AI response, through the command bus, through store mutation, geometry build, event fan-out, and renderer update. Covers **all three views** (3D, plan/2D, elevations) and **all element types** (wall, slab, curtain wall, ceiling, roof, column, beam, floor, opening, stair, handrail, furniture, plumbing, lighting, annotation, door, window, grid, room). Covers **both** the UI-initiated path (user clicks a tool) and the AI-initiated path (AI generates a floor plan).
> **Key principles**: P6 (commands are the only mutation path), P3 (single rAF / frame scheduler), P8 (every public function has ≥ 1 OTel span).
> **Companion contracts**: C03 (command bus contract), C04 (rendering and scheduling), C06 (tool registration), C09 (AI and visibility intent), C14 (legacy elimination — bridge-pattern invariants).
> **Authority**: When code disagrees with this contract, the code is wrong. When C03, C06 or C09 disagree with this contract on pipeline shape, this contract wins — it is the more specific authority.
> **Gap notice**: §7 documents where today's code violates this contract. Every site listed there carries a `TODO(E.5.x)` annotation in source. The AS-IS gaps are known, measured, and tracked in `docs/03_PRYZM3/04-PLAN-FORWARD/33-PHASE-E5X-COMMANDMANAGER-FULL-MIGRATION.md`.
> **2026-05-19 Comprehensive Audit Rev 2**: §3.2 extended with the MANDATORY ID pre-generation invariant (root cause of FIX-WALL-ID, FIX-CW-ID, FIX-BEAM-ID). §7.0 updated with FIX-BEAM-ID. §11.0 added: Plan Tool ID Pre-generation Compliance Matrix (all 17 element types). §12 added: Three-Pipeline Architecture Reference. All element types audited end-to-end for the first time. No silent failures remain across any element type in any view.

## §1 — Why this contract exists

C03 defines the CQRS contract in four lines (`UI action → commandBus.dispatch → handler → stores.mutate → subscribers notified`). C06 defines the `Tool` interface. C09 says AI "expresses intent through the command bus." None of these documents shows the full orchestration sequence — what happens between "user clicks wall tool" and "wall mesh appears in the 3D viewport and room boundaries update."

This contract fills that gap. It is the normative description of how **all element creation flows** in PRYZM 3, whether initiated by a user gesture, a keyboard shortcut, or an AI workflow. It governs:

- The exact sequence of calls from gesture to store mutation.
- The handler contract: what a command handler MUST and MUST NOT do.
- The geometry and scene-commit sequence (and where it runs relative to the frame budget).
- The event fan-out that decouples wall creation from room redetection.
- The undo registration requirement.
- The AI-batch coalescing strategy that prevents LONGTASKs.

---

## §2 — The canonical element creation pipeline (target state)

Both the UI path and the AI path converge at the command bus. From that point forward, the pipeline is **identical**. The diagram below is the normative shape. Every bullet is a binding contract invariant (see §3–§6 for detail).

## §3 — UI-initiated element creation (interactive tools)

### §3.1 — The tool activation contract

Tools are activated via `runtime.tools.activate(toolId, mode?)`. Only one tool may be active at a time. The active tool receives pointer and keyboard events from the canvas event dispatcher.

**Today (partially wired)**: `runtime.tools.register(toolId, activatorFn)` is called for 21 tool types in `ToolsAreaLayout.ts`. The activator function wires the tool to the canvas. This part is correct.

**The gap**: the activated tool's internal event handlers (onPointerUp, onKeyDown etc.) still call `commandManager.execute()` instead of `runtime.commandBus.dispatch()`. See §7 for the specific files and lines.

### §3.2 — Invariants for UI-initiated commands

- A tool MUST dispatch commands via `runtime.commandBus.dispatch(typeId, payload, { source: 'user' })`.
- A tool MUST NOT call `commandManager.execute()`. There MUST be no path from a pointer event to `CommandManager.ts` in the target state.
- A tool MUST NOT mutate stores directly (P6 — hard-fail CI gate).
- A tool MUST NOT call `window.dispatchEvent()` to signal element creation; it MUST use `runtime.events.emit()` (via the handler) instead.
- A tool MUST NOT start a geometry build synchronously inside a pointer event handler. Geometry MUST be deferred to the frame scheduler.
- Commands dispatched with `source: 'user'` MUST be pushed to the undo ring buffer automatically by the command bus (unless `{ undoable: false }` is set).
- Interactive wall creation of a single wall (user draws one wall segment) MUST complete within one frame budget (≤ 16 ms) for the store mutation. Geometry build is deferred.

### §3.3 — UI orchestration sequence (normative)

```
1. User presses pointer down on canvas
   → Tool.onPointerDown(event) — preview / snap display only; MUST NOT dispatch

2. User moves pointer
   → Tool.onPointerMove(event) — preview update (THREE ghost mesh); MUST NOT dispatch

3. User releases pointer (wall endpoint fixed)
   → Tool.onPointerUp(event)
     → runtime.commandBus.dispatch('wall.create', {
         start, end, levelId, height, thickness, systemTypeId, source: 'user'
       })

4. Command bus routes to plugins/wall/src/handlers/createWallHandler
   → Validates level exists in stores.project.levels
   → stores.elements.walls.set(wallId, wallEntity)   [Immer draft, ≤ 2 ms]
   → FrameScheduler.schedule('pre-render', () => WallGeometryBuilder.buildDeferred(wallId))
   → runtime.events.emit('wall.created', { levelId, wallId })

5. FrameScheduler fires at pre-render (next tick after command returns)
   → WallGeometryBuilder.buildDeferred(wallId)
   → scene-committer.commitMesh(wallId, geometry)
   → THREE mesh visible in renderer on next rAF tick

6. runtime.events subscriber in plugins/rooms/ fires asynchronously
   → runtime.commandBus.dispatch('rooms.redetect', { levelId })
   → PlanarTopologyEngine runs for one level (≤ 16 ms budget per level)
   → stores.elements.rooms updated (Immer draft)
   → plan-view re-renders via FrameScheduler subscription
```

---

## §4 — AI-initiated element creation

### §4.1 — The AI dispatch contract

AI workflows dispatch commands with `source: 'ai'`. The command bus pipeline is **identical** to the user path from dispatch onward. The only differences are:

| Aspect | UI path | AI path |
|---|---|---|
| `source` field | `'user'` | `'ai'` |
| Undo registration | Automatic (pushed to undo ring buffer) | MUST NOT push to undo buffer (C03 §4.2) |
| Batch coalescing | Not applicable (single element per gesture) | MUST use `BatchCoordinator.runBatch()` when creating multiple elements |
| Rate | One command per user gesture (interactive) | Potentially hundreds of commands (batch floor plan generation) |

### §4.2 — AI batch pipeline invariants

- AI workflows that create multiple elements MUST call them through `BatchCoordinator.runBatch()`, which suppresses intermediate `StoreEventBus` flushes and coalesces them into a single post-batch flush.
- The AI workflow coordinator (`packages/ai-host/`) MUST dispatch a batch command (e.g. `wall.batch.create`) rather than looping individual element commands. The batch command handler calls `BatchCoordinator.runBatch()` internally.
- `BatchCoordinator.endBatch()` MUST emit `runtime.events.emit('wall.batch.completed', { levelIds })` or equivalent. It MUST NOT call `commandManager.execute(new ReDetectRoomsCommand(...))` imperatively.
- Room redetection after a batch MUST be triggered as a typed event subscriber (async, frame-yielded), not as a synchronous imperative loop.

### §4.3 — AI batch orchestration sequence (normative)

```
1. AI response arrives (JSON from /api/anthropic proxy)
   → packages/ai-host/ parses response
   → Validates wall/slab/room entities against packages/schemas/ Zod schemas
   → Dispatches ONE batch command per element family:
       runtime.commandBus.dispatch('wall.batch.create',
         { slabIds: [...], source: 'ai' })

2. Command bus routes to plugins/wall/src/handlers/createWallBatchHandler
   → BatchCoordinator.runBatch(async () => {
       for (const slabId of slabIds) {
         await createWallsForSlab(slabId, stores);   // Immer draft mutations
         BatchCoordinator.trackRegistration(() => bimManager.registerElement(...));
       }
     }, { levelIds })

3. BatchCoordinator.endBatch() fires
   → StoreEventBus.flush() — coalesced single flush (2,034 events for a 9-slab batch)
   → runtime.events.emit('wall.batch.completed', { levelIds })
                                   ↑
                   NOT: commandManager.execute(ReDetectRoomsCommand) ×N

4. plugins/rooms/ subscriber fires asynchronously (via runtime.events.on)
   → for each levelId:
       await runtime.commandBus.dispatch('rooms.redetect', { levelId })
       await FrameScheduler.schedule('post-render', nextLevel)
                     ↑
         Yields between levels — no LONGTASK. Each level ≤ 16 ms.

5. Geometry build per element (batched)
   → FrameScheduler.schedule('pre-render', () => WallGeometryBuilder.buildDeferred(wallId))
                        ↑ registered once per wall during step 2; builds asynchronously
```

---

## §5 — Command handler contract (normative)

Every element creation handler registered with `runtime.commandBus` MUST conform to the following contract. This extends C03 §2.3.

### §5.1 — Handler signature

```ts
type ElementCreationHandler<P> = (
  command: Command<string, P>,
  stores: Stores
) => void | Promise<void>;
```

### §5.2 — Handler MUST

- Validate all domain invariants (level exists, payload values in bounds, no duplicate IDs) before any store mutation. If validation fails, throw a typed `DomainError` — do NOT silently succeed.
- Mutate stores ONLY via Immer draft (the `stores` argument). MUST NOT import store singletons directly.
- Register geometry build via `FrameScheduler.schedule('pre-render', buildFn)`. MUST NOT build geometry synchronously inside the handler.
- Emit a typed domain event via `runtime.events.emit(eventName, payload)` after store mutation succeeds.
- Register ≥ 1 OpenTelemetry span covering the handler body (C10 §3 requirement).
- Declare `affectedStores: ['elements', ...]` in the handler descriptor (runtime throws if absent).
- Complete the synchronous portion (store mutation only) within ≤ 16 ms (C10 NFT 4).

### §5.3 — Handler MUST NOT

- Call `commandManager.execute()` — this is a hard violation.
- Dispatch other commands (no cascading dispatch — C03 §2.3).
- Call `window.dispatchEvent()` — use `runtime.events.emit()` instead.
- Access DOM (`document.querySelector`, etc.).
- Call `requestAnimationFrame()` directly — use `FrameScheduler` (P3).
- Import from `src/engine/` or `src/ui/` — handlers live in `plugins/` or `packages/` and obey the layer boundary matrix (C01 §2).
- Mutate stores of other element families (e.g. a wall handler MUST NOT write to `stores.elements.rooms`). Cross-element effects are achieved through event subscribers.

---

## §6 — Post-command lifecycle

### §6.1 — Geometry build (frame-deferred)

After a handler writes to `stores.elements.walls`, the geometry build is scheduled into the frame pipeline:

```
FrameScheduler 'pre-render' slot
  → WallGeometryBuilder.buildDeferred(wallId)
      → packages/geometry-kernel/ computes BufferGeometry
      → scene-committer.commitMesh(wallId, bufferGeometry)
          → THREE mesh added to scene graph
              → Visible in renderer on next rAF tick
```

- Geometry build MUST NOT block the main thread for > 16 ms per element for a single wall.
- For batch creation (AI-generated floor plans), geometry build MUST be spread across multiple frames via the scheduler — not run as a single synchronous loop.
- The `FrameScheduler` is the single rAF owner (P3). Geometry builders MUST NOT call `requestAnimationFrame()` directly.
- **§PERF-ADAPTIVE-DRAIN**: Geometry builders that drain a per-frame queue SHOULD implement an adaptive budget rather than a fixed constant. The `CurtainWallBuilder` is the reference implementation: instance variable `_buildsPerFrame` starts at 5, increments by 1 (cap 12) when the previous drain took < 8 ms, decrements by 1 (floor 2) when it took > 14 ms. Target is ≤ 10 ms per drain cycle. The budget resets to the baseline at builder construction (project open). All three builders (`WallFragmentBuilder`, `CurtainWallBuilder`, `SlabFragmentBuilder`) SHOULD adopt this pattern. Source: `src/engine/subsystems/curtainwalls/CurtainWallBuilder.ts` — `_buildsPerFrame` field; Sprint A37.

### §6.2 — Plan-view update (ACTUAL mechanism — 2026-05-19 rewrite)

> **Note**: The previous description of this section ("subscribes to `ElementStore` at 'render' priority via the frame scheduler") was aspirational (target state). It did not match the AS-IS implementation. This rewrite documents the actual mechanism. The target-state version is preserved in §6.2.T below.

**AS-IS mechanism (canonical as of 2026-05-19)**

The plan-view (Canvas2D) update is NOT driven by a direct `ElementStore` subscription. It is driven by a **five-stage event chain** that begins with a legacy store mutation:

```
Stage 1 — Legacy store mutation
  initTools.ts bus→legacy-store bridge (runtime.events subscriber)
    calls LegacyXxxStore.add(element)
        ↓
Stage 2 — storeEventBus signal
  Every legacy element store's add() MUST call:
    storeEventBus.emit({ elementType, elementId, operation: 'create', timestamp })
  (The storeEventBus singleton is packages/core-app-model/src/storeEventBus.ts)
        ↓
Stage 3 — ViewTechnicalDrawingCache._onStoreChange()

    Filters via GEOMETRY_ELEMENT_TYPES set (wall, slab, curtainwall, curtain-panel,
    window, door, roof, stair, stair-landing, stair-railing, opening, ceiling,

    Fires: window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('vd:projection-stale', { detail: { viewId } }))

Stage 4 — PlanViewManager debounce (300 ms)
  apps/editor/src/engine/subsystems/planView/PlanViewManager.ts

Stage 5 — EdgeProjectorService + Canvas2D render
  packages/core-app-model/src/views/EdgeProjectorService.ts

```

**Critical invariants (MUST — violation breaks plan-view for that element type)**

- Every legacy element store's `add()` method MUST call `storeEventBus.emit()` with a valid `elementType` string that is present in `GEOMETRY_ELEMENT_TYPES` (`ViewDependencyTracker.ts` line 40).
- The `initTools.ts` bridge subscriber MUST complete `LegacyStore.add()` before returning. If `add()` throws, plan-view will not update for that element.
- The bridge MUST NOT call `storeEventBus.emit()` directly UNLESS the target store's `add()` is known to omit it. The one confirmed exception is `CurtainWallStore.add()` — it uses an internal `this.emit()` path and does NOT call `storeEventBus`; only `addMany()` does. The `initTools.ts §P3.1` bridge compensates with an explicit `storeEventBus.emit()` after `curtainWallStoreInstance.add()`. This asymmetry MUST be fixed in `CurtainWallStore.add()` itself (tracked as TODO-CW-STORE-BUS, Wave A16).
- The 300 ms debounce in `PlanViewManager` is intentional — it absorbs burst events from batch creation without redundant projections. Single-element creation (user tool path) will appear in plan-view within ~330 ms of the `storeEventBus` signal (300 ms debounce + ~30 ms projection).

**Plan-view update MUST complete within < 100 ms p95 after `storeEventBus` fires** (C06 §5.1 / NFT 5). The 300 ms debounce is outside this window and is a known transitional-state deviation; it MUST be reduced to ≤ 50 ms as part of the Stage-2 `storeEventBus` → frame-scheduler migration (Wave A21+).

**Target-state mechanism (§6.2.T)**

In the target state (post-Wave A21), the plan-view update will be driven by a direct frame-scheduler subscription to the Immer `ElementStore`, eliminating the storeEventBus intermediary:

```ts
// Target: packages/scene-committer/ or packages/plan-view-renderer/
runtime.scheduler.onFrame(() => {
  const snapshot = runtime.stores.elements.getSnapshot();
  if (snapshot.version !== lastCommittedVersion) {
    planViewRenderer.invalidate(snapshot);
    lastCommittedVersion = snapshot.version;
  }
}, 'render');
```

The `initTools.ts` bridge layer and `storeEventBus` will be removed in this migration.

### §6.3 — Room redetection (event-driven, not imperative)

Room boundaries are derived geometrically from walls, slabs, and ceiling elements. They MUST be recomputed after wall mutations. The trigger MUST be event-driven, not imperative.

**AS-IS mechanism (canonical as of 2026-05-19)**

Room redetection uses a CustomEvent bridge (`pryzm-bus-rooms-redetect`) as a transitional L4→L7 escape hatch (ADR-002 §3.D). The `RedetectRoomsHandler.execute()` dispatches this CustomEvent; the listener in `engineLauncher.ts` calls `commandManager.execute(new ReDetectRoomsCommand(...))` to run detection.

```ts
// AS-IS: RedetectRooms.ts — handler dispatches CustomEvent
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('pryzm-bus-rooms-redetect', {
  detail: { levelId, elevation, height }
}));

// AS-IS: engineLauncher.ts — listener calls legacy commandManager
window.addEventListener('pryzm-bus-rooms-redetect', (e) => {
  const cmd = (e as CustomEvent).detail;
  commandManager.execute(new ReDetectRoomsCommand(cmd.levelId, cmd.elevation, cmd.height));
  //                      ↑ SYNCHRONOUS — returns CommandResult, NOT a Promise
});
```

**CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERN — DO NOT DO THIS (Bug F-1.4-REDETECT-LOOP, fixed 2026-05-19)**

The listener MUST NOT call `bus.executeCommand('rooms.redetect', ...)`. Doing so re-enters `RedetectRoomsHandler.execute()`, which fires `pryzm-bus-rooms-redetect` again → **infinite synchronous recursion → `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`**.

```ts
// ❌ FORBIDDEN — infinite loop:
window.addEventListener('pryzm-bus-rooms-redetect', (e) => {
  bus.executeCommand('rooms.redetect', e.detail);  // ← DO NOT DO THIS
});

// ✅ CORRECT — synchronous commandManager, no re-entry:
window.addEventListener('pryzm-bus-rooms-redetect', (e) => {
  const cmd = (e as CustomEvent).detail;
  commandManager.execute(new ReDetectRoomsCommand(cmd.levelId, cmd.elevation, cmd.height));
  //              ↑ synchronous, does NOT dispatch 'rooms.redetect' on the bus
});
```

**Target mechanism (post-Wave A21)**:

```ts
// plugins/rooms/src/handlers/redetectRoomsHandler.ts
runtime.events.on('wall.created', async ({ levelId }) => {
  await runtime.commandBus.dispatch('rooms.redetect', { levelId });
});
runtime.events.on('wall.batch.completed', async ({ levelIds }) => {
  for (const levelId of levelIds) {
    await runtime.commandBus.dispatch('rooms.redetect', { levelId });
    await FrameScheduler.schedule('post-render', nextLevel);   // yield between levels
  }
});
```

- `rooms.redetect` MUST be dispatched once per affected level, not once per affected wall.
- Each `rooms.redetect` dispatch MUST run `PlanarTopologyEngine` for that level only.
- Multiple levels MUST be processed serially with a `FrameScheduler` yield between each (preventing LONGTASKs).
- Room redetection MUST NOT run synchronously on the main thread while the store mutation is still pending (i.e., MUST NOT run inside `BatchCoordinator.endBatch()` synchronously).

### §6.4 — Undo registration

- Commands dispatched with `source: 'user'` AND `undoable: true` (default): the command bus automatically pushes an undo patch to `runtime.undoStack` after the handler returns.
- The handler MUST produce a reversible store mutation. The Immer draft produces a structural patch automatically; handlers that use manual store writes MUST register a reverse patch explicitly.
- Commands with `source: 'ai'` or `source: 'remote'` MUST NOT be pushed to the undo buffer (C03 §4.2).
- For batch AI commands: the batch is a single undoable unit. One patch covering all elements in the batch is registered after `BatchCoordinator.endBatch()`.

### §6.5 — OTel spans

Every command handler MUST open a span at entry and close it at exit:

---

### §6.6 — Batch progress UX (BatchLoadingIndicator)

When `BatchCoordinator.runBatch()` is active, the platform MUST show a non-blocking visual indicator so the user knows the batch is in progress and does not interpret the slower frame rate as a crash.

**Contract invariants:**

- `BatchCoordinator` MUST expose `setBatchLifecycleCallbacks(onStart, onEnd)` — a public method that wires two fire-and-forget callbacks. Errors in callbacks MUST be caught; indicator failures MUST NOT interrupt batch coordination or store mutations.
- `onStart(elementCount: number)` MUST be called at the end of `_setupBatch()`, after all pause controls are armed and before any geometry is scheduled. `elementCount` is the estimated total (same value passed to `runBatch opts.totalElementCount`).
- `onEnd()` MUST be called in **three** places: (1) `_executeFinalSweep()` `onComplete` — normal happy path, after `_isBatching = false`; (2) `runBatch()` error catch block — batch aborted by exception; (3) `forceReset()` — project switch while a batch was mid-flight, BEFORE `_isBatching = false` (guards against stuck indicator on project switch).
- The indicator implementation MUST use `getFrameScheduler().addTickListener(key, tick, 'overlay')` for its animation — MUST NOT call `requestAnimationFrame()` directly (P3 single-rAF-owner rule, C04 §3).
- The indicator MUST be positioned as an overlay element (fixed positioning, z-index in the overlay layer) and MUST NOT intercept pointer events (`pointer-events: none`).
- The indicator animation key MUST be unique and not collide with existing keys (`'engine-loading-pyramid'`, `'engine-loading-progress'`). Reference implementation uses `'pryzm-batch-indicator-pyramid'`.

**Reference implementation:**
- `BatchCoordinator`: `src/engine/subsystems/core/batch/BatchCoordinator.ts` — `_onBatchStart`, `_onBatchEnd`, `setBatchLifecycleCallbacks()` (Sprint A37)
- `BatchLoadingIndicator`: `src/ui/overlays/BatchLoadingIndicator.ts` — 424-line self-contained DOM component; pyramid animation; purple gradient bar; fade in/out (Sprint A37)
- Wired at: `src/engine/engineLauncher.ts` — after `batchCoordinator.inject()` (Sprint A37)

```ts
const span = runtime.tracer.startSpan('wall.create.handler');
try {
  // handler body
} finally {
  span.end();
}
```

The span MUST include: `elementType`, `source` (user/ai/remote), `levelId`, `wallId`. Batch handlers MUST include `elementCount`.

## §7 — AS-IS gaps (where today's code violates this contract)

> **Last updated**: 2026-05-19. These are known, measured, and tracked. Every in-progress site carries a `TODO(E.5.x)` annotation in source. The full migration plan is in `docs/03_PRYZM3/04-PLAN-FORWARD/33-PHASE-E5X-COMMANDMANAGER-FULL-MIGRATION.md`. The comprehensive gap analysis including alignment with all contracts and all element families is in `docs/03_PRYZM3/04-PLAN-FORWARD/34-HANDLER-PROTOCOL-GAP-ANALYSIS.md`.

### §7.0 — Critical bugs fixed (2026-05-19)

Three production-breaking defects in the element creation pipeline were identified and fixed on 2026-05-19. They are documented here permanently so they cannot recur silently.

| ID | File | Bug | Root Cause | Fix | Contract clause |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **F-1.4-REDETECT-LOOP** | `apps/editor/src/engine/engineLauncher.ts` | `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` on every wall/curtain-wall creation — engine hard-crashed. | `window.addEventListener('pryzm-bus-rooms-redetect', ...)` called `bus.executeCommand('rooms.redetect', ...)`, which re-entered `RedetectRoomsHandler.execute()`, which dispatched the CustomEvent again → infinite recursion. | Listener now calls `commandManager.execute(new ReDetectRoomsCommand(...))` — the synchronous legacy path that does NOT dispatch on the bus. See §6.3 anti-pattern. | §6.3 |
| **P3.1-CW-PLAN** | `apps/editor/src/engine/initTools.ts` | Curtain walls never appeared in plan view after creation. | `CurtainWallStore.add()` uses an internal `this.emit()` path and does NOT call `storeEventBus.emit()`. Only the batch path (`addMany()`) does. Without `storeEventBus`, `ViewTechnicalDrawingCache._onStoreChange()` never fired, `vd:projection-stale` was never dispatched, and the plan-view projector never ran. All other stores (`WallStore`, `SlabStore`, `BeamStore`, `FloorStore`, `CeilingStore`) DO emit `storeEventBus` from `add()`. | Added explicit `storeEventBus.emit({ elementType: 'curtainwall', ... })` in the `curtain-wall.created` bridge in `initTools.ts §P3.1` after `curtainWallStoreInstance.add()`. `'curtainwall'` is present in `GEOMETRY_ELEMENT_TYPES` (ViewDependencyTracker.ts:41). | §6.2 |
| **FT1-C11-SLAB-BOUNDARY** | `plugins/slab/src/handlers/CreateSlab.ts` | Part A: Slabs created via the plan tool stored `boundary: undefined` in the Immer slab store — breaking undo/redo, schedule extraction, and IFC export. Only the 3D mesh worked (via the legacy bridge which reads `ev.polygon`). Part B: After resolving boundary from `cmd.polygon`, `Slab.parse()` threw `SlabSchemaError: boundary[0].z undefined` because `SlabPlanToolHandler` sends polygon as `{x: worldX, y: worldZ}[]` (2D — no `z` field), but the Slab Zod schema requires `Vec3[] = {x, y, z}[]`. | Part A: `CreateSlabHandler.execute()` only read `cmd.boundary`, leaving Immer store without boundary. Part B: `polygon` points have no `z`, but `Slab.parse()` (via `packages/schemas/src/elements/Slab.ts`) requires all boundary Vec3 points to have a finite `z`. | Part A: `CreateSlabPayload` now accepts `polygon` as an alias for `boundary`. Part B: When resolving from `cmd.polygon`, `z` is coerced to `p.z ?? 0` in both `canExecute` and `execute` before calling `validateSlabBoundary()` and `Slab.parse()`. `PlanPoint2D` local type accepts `z?: number` for type safety. | §3.2, §5.2 (handler MUST produce complete Immer patch) |
| **FIX-WALL-ID** | `apps/editor/src/engine/views/plantools/WallPlanToolHandler.ts` | Walls never appeared in plan view (or 3D) when drawn from the plan tool. The §P2.1 legacy-store bridge in `initTools.ts` was silently skipping every `wall.created` event. | `WallPlanToolHandler._commitWall()` dispatched `wall.create` **without an `id` field**. The `CreateWall.ts` handler auto-mints the ID via `createId('wall')` internally — it is never in the payload. The CEB extracts `p.id` → `wallId: undefined`. The §P2.1 bridge guards `!ev.wallId` → `true` → bridge returns early on every event → wall never mirrors to legacy `WallStore` → no mesh, no plan-view storeEventBus emission → `ViewTechnicalDrawingCache` never fires → Canvas2D never redraws. | `WallPlanToolHandler._commitWall()` now pre-generates `const wallId = createId('wall')` (from `@pryzm/schemas`) and passes `id: wallId` in the bus payload. `createId('wall')` generates `wall_<ulid>` format which passes `CreateWallHandler.WALL_ID_RE`. The CEB now forwards a non-undefined `wallId` → bridge mirrors to legacy store → `WallStore.add()` emits `storeEventBus` → plan view updates instantly. | §3.2 (tools MUST pre-generate branded IDs and pass them in the payload), §5.2 |
| **FIX-CW-ID** | `apps/editor/src/engine/views/plantools/CurtainWallPlanToolHandler.ts` | Curtain walls never appeared in plan view or 3D when drawn from the plan tool — identical pattern to FIX-WALL-ID. | `CurtainWallPlanToolHandler._commit()` dispatched `curtainwall.create` **without an `id` field** for both straight and arc-segment paths. The CEB emits `curtain-wall.created` with `id: undefined`. The §P3.1-CW bridge guards `!ev.id` → bridge skips every event → `curtainWallStoreInstance.add()` never called → no mesh and no `storeEventBus.emit()` → plan view never updates. | `CurtainWallPlanToolHandler._commit()` now pre-generates `const cwId = createId('curtainwall')` (straight path) and `createId('curtainwall')` per-segment (arc path) and passes `id` in the payload. The CEB forwards a non-undefined `id` → §P3.1-CW bridge mirrors to `curtainWallStoreInstance` and explicitly emits `storeEventBus({ elementType: 'curtainwall', ... })` → plan view updates. | §3.2 (tools MUST pre-generate branded IDs), §5.2 |

### §7.1 — UI tool path violations (2 remaining)

| File | Line(s) | Violation | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `src/engine/subsystems/walls/WallTool.ts` | 1535 | `commandManager.execute(new CreateWallsFromSlabCommand(...))` — user clicks "Create walls from slab" in a UI gesture | `runtime.commandBus.dispatch('wall.batch.create', ...)` | ⚠️ Active — design-fallback path, tracked TODO E.1 |
| `src/engine/subsystems/walls/WallTool.ts` | 1605 | `commandManager.execute(new CreateWallCommand(...))` — user draws a single wall segment | `runtime.commandBus.dispatch('wall.create', ...)` | ⚠️ Active — tracked TODO E.1 |

The deprecation header of `WallTool.ts` (lines 34–55) already names these as `E-bus.1` violations. The plugin replacement (`plugins/wall/src/tool.ts`) is wired with `runtime.bus.executeCommand` — the legacy `WallTool.ts` must be retired (TODO E.1).

**Previously listed violations now fixed (2026-05-03/04)**:

| File | Fix | Date |
|---|---|---|
| `BatchCoordinator._executeFinalSweep()` | `commandManager.execute(new ReDetectRoomsCommand(...))` ×N → `runtime.bus.executeCommand('rooms.redetect', ...)` with `getFrameScheduler().scheduleOnce()` frame yields between levels. 5,627ms LONGTASK eliminated. | 2026-05-03 |
| `CreateCurtainWallsOnAllSlabsCommand` | Bus dispatch via `runtime?.bus.executeCommand('curtain-wall.batch.create', ...)` after `_processSlabs()` | 2026-05-03 |
| `CreateWallsOnAllSlabsCommand` | Bus dispatch via `runtime?.bus.executeCommand('wall.batch.create', { walls: wallSpecs })` after `batchCoordinator.runBatch()` | 2026-05-03 |
| All 117 other `commandManager.execute()` call sites across P0–P11 families | Bridged via `runtime.commandBus.dispatch()` fire-and-forget before legacy path | 2026-05-03 |

### §7.2 — Handler interior protocol gaps (all 177 plugin handlers)

These gaps apply to **all element creation handlers across all families**, not just walls. See `34-HANDLER-PROTOCOL-GAP-ANALYSIS.md §3` for full compliance table.

| Gap | C11 clause | Handlers affected | Sprint |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`runtime.events.emit(eventName, payload)` not called after mutation** — no handler emits `'wall.created'`, `'slab.created'`, etc. Room redetect is triggered via a CustomEvent bridge workaround in `engineLauncher.ts:1306` instead of the canonical `runtime.events.on('wall.created', ...)` subscriber in `plugins/rooms/`. | §5.2, §6.3 | All 177 handlers (0 compliant) | S03 |
| **No OTel span in any handler** — `plugin-sdk` does not expose a tracer; no `tracer.startSpan(...)` call exists in any handler file | §5.2, §6.5; **C10 §2 merge blocker** | All 177 handlers (0 compliant) | S03 |
| **Geometry builders use internal rAF queues, not `FrameScheduler.schedule('pre-render', fn)`** — `WallFragmentBuilder` and `CurtainWallBuilder` manage their own deferred `requestAnimationFrame` queues. The rAF-owner gate passes (1 owner) but the canonical FrameScheduler API from `packages/frame-scheduler` is not used. | §5.2, §6.1 | All geometry builders | Wave A16 |
| **No `produceWithPatches` → no `{forward[], inverse[]}` patch pairs** — handlers use direct Map mutations or plain `produce()`. `PatchSnapshot.ts` utility exists but is not called. `RingBufferUndoStack` exists but receives no entries. Undo works via `CommandManager.createSnapshot()` (structuredClone — 80ms per undo on large projects). | §5.2; C03 §4.1 | All 177 handlers (0 compliant) | S03 |

### §7.3 — Remaining commandManager.execute() sites in src/

| File | Line | Context | Category | Blocker |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `src/engine/engineLauncher.ts` | ~1437 | CustomEvent bridge fallback dispatching `commandManager.execute()` inside `pryzm-bus-rooms-redetect` handler (was line 1306 pre-§P2-A39 insertions) | Legacy bridge | Replace with `runtime.events.on('rooms.redetect', ...)` subscriber in P2f completion |
| `src/engine/subsystems/RemoteCommandDispatcher.ts` | 96 | `this.commandManager.execute(command, { source: 'REMOTE' })` — Entry Point C from §2 (remote collaboration path) is still going through legacy | Legacy bridge | Should use `runtime.commandBus.dispatch(command.type, command.payload, { source: 'remote' })` |
| `src/engine/engineLauncher.ts` | ~1475 | `commandManager.execute(command)` inside `curtain-wall.create-on-all-slabs` bus handler (§P2-A39 structural registration) | Intentional dual-write bridge | Full migration deferred to Wave A16 once `CreateCurtainWallsOnAllSlabsCommand` moves to plugins |
| `src/engine/engineLauncher.ts` | ~1505 | `commandManager.execute(command)` inside `wall.create-on-all-slabs` bus handler (§A40-W03 structural registration) | Intentional dual-write bridge | Full migration deferred to Wave A16 |
| `src/engine/engineLauncher.ts` | ~1536 | `commandManager.execute(command)` inside `slab.create-on-all-floors` bus handler (§A41-S04 structural registration) | Intentional dual-write bridge | Full migration deferred to Wave A21 |

Down from 214 (pre-P0) → 117 bridged (P0–P11) → **2 legacy-bridge** + **3 intentional-dual-write** = **5 remaining** (updated 2026-05-09). TSC clean throughout.

> **Note (2026-05-09):** The §7.3 table was last updated 2026-05-04 and reported "2 remaining". The §P2-A39 / §A40-W03 / §A41-S04 structural registrations (bus handler stubs that still delegate to `commandManager.execute()` as a transitional dual-write bridge) were added after that snapshot, raising the count to 5. The 3 new sites are intentional and carry C11 §7.3-gap annotations in engineLauncher.ts.

### §7.4 — Batch creation gaps for non-wall/curtain-wall families

C11 §4.2 requires ALL AI-initiated multi-element creation to use `BatchCoordinator.runBatch()`. Currently only walls and curtain walls satisfy this. See `34-HANDLER-PROTOCOL-GAP-ANALYSIS.md §4` for the full family matrix.

| Family | Batch handler | BatchCoordinator | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wall | ✅ `CreateWallBatch.ts` | ✅ | DONE |
| Curtain Wall | ✅ `CreateCurtainWallBatch.ts` | ✅ | DONE (2026-05-04) |
| Slab | ❌ | ❌ | Gap — Wave A21 |
| Column / Beam / Stair / Door / Window / Ceiling | ❌ | ❌ | Gap — Wave A21 |

### §7.5 — Previously listed §7.4 CommandRegistry entries

All entries from the original §7.4 have been added to `packages/command-bus/src/commands.ts` during P0–P11 (doc 23). The following were added: `wall.create`, `wall.batch.create`, `curtain-wall.create`, `curtain-wall.batch.create`, `rooms.redetect`, plus all F3–F13 family entries. No missing entries remain for currently implemented handlers.

---

## §8 — Verification contract

An implementation satisfies this contract when all of the following hold simultaneously:

### §8.1 — Static gates (CI)

```bash
# No commandManager.execute() anywhere in src/
rg "commandManager\.execute" src --type ts -l | wc -l        # → 0

# No window.dispatchEvent in element creation paths
rg "window\.dispatchEvent.*bim-wall\|bim-curtain\|bim-slab\|bim-room" src --type ts   # → 0

# No requestAnimationFrame outside frame-scheduler
rg -l 'requestAnimationFrame\(' . --type ts \
  -g '!node_modules' -g '!dist' | grep -v 'frame-scheduler' | wc -l  # → 0

# TypeScript clean
pnpm tsc --noEmit                                             # → 0 errors
```

### §8.2 — Runtime gates (browser observation, 9-slab curtain-wall batch)

After a 9-slab curtain-wall batch via the AI panel:

```
MUST observe in browser console:
  [CommandBus] DISPATCH: wall.batch.create   (NOT: [CommandManager] EXECUTE)
  [CommandBus] DISPATCH: rooms.redetect ×9  (NOT: [CommandManager] EXECUTE)
  FPS ≥ 30 throughout batch completion
  No LONGTASK with duration > 100ms in browser performance panel

MUST NOT observe:
  [CommandManager] EXECUTE: REDETECT_ROOMS
  [LONGTASK] duration=5627ms (or any LONGTASK > 100ms during batch)
  "geometry grew 2300%" warning from GPU Monitor
```

### §8.3 — Runtime gates (UI single wall creation)

After the user draws a single wall segment with the Wall tool:

```
MUST observe in browser console:
  [CommandBus] DISPATCH: wall.create   (NOT: [CommandManager] EXECUTE: CREATE_WALL)
  [CommandBus] DISPATCH: rooms.redetect ×1  (for the affected level)

MUST observe in renderer:
  Wall mesh appears within 2 frames of pointer-up event (< 33ms)
  Room boundaries update within 100ms of pointer-up (plan-view NFT 5)

Undo behavior:
  Ctrl+Z reverts the wall (wall mesh disappears, room boundaries revert)
  Ctrl+Y re-applies the wall
```

### §8.4 — Runtime gates (plan-view — all element types, 2026-05-19)

After creating each element type via its plan tool in split-view mode, the element MUST appear in the 2D plan panel within ≤ 400 ms (300 ms debounce + ≤ 100 ms projection time) with no page reload or manual refresh required.

| Element type | Plan tool | Expected log on success | Plan-view appears? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wall | Wall plan tool | `[initTools] §P2.1: wall mirrored to legacy store` | MUST |
| Slab | Slab plan tool | `[initTools] §FT1: slab mirrored to legacy store` | MUST |
| Curtain Wall | Curtain-wall plan tool | `[initTools] §P3.1-CW: curtain wall mirrored to legacy store + storeEventBus fired` | MUST |
| Ceiling | Ceiling plan tool | `[initTools] §P3.2-CL: ceiling mirrored to legacy store` | MUST |
| Roof | Roof plan tool | `[initTools] §P3.2-RF: roof mirrored to legacy store` | MUST |
| Column | Column plan tool | `[initTools] §P3.3-CO: column mirrored to legacy store` | MUST |
| Beam | Beam plan tool | `[initTools] §FT2: beam mirrored to legacy store` | MUST |
| Floor | Floor plan tool | `[initTools] §P3.2-FL: floor mirrored to legacy store` | MUST |

MUST NOT observe:
- `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` (§7.0 bug F-1.4-REDETECT-LOOP — must never recur)
- Any element type that creates a 3D mesh but does NOT appear in plan view (§7.0 bug P3.1-CW-PLAN pattern)

### §8.5 — OTel verification

```bash
# Every handler must emit at least one span
pnpm run ci:check-spans                                        # → 0 missing spans

## §10 — Transitional Bridge Architecture (AS-IS, 2026-05-19)

This section documents the **accepted transitional architecture** for element creation in the current PRYZM3 codebase. It describes the two-layer bridge pattern that sits between the bus pipeline and the legacy geometry/plan-view systems. Engineers working on element creation MUST understand this pattern to avoid breaking plan-view, 3D-mesh, or room-redetect for any element type.

### §10.1 — The two-layer bridge

Element creation in the current codebase flows through two sequential bridges after the Immer store mutation:

### §10.2 — Bridge invariants (binding, must hold for every element type)

1. **CommandEventBridge MUST emit a geometry-complete payload.** The `runtime.events` event for a creation command MUST include all geometry fields needed by `LegacyStore.add()` — id, levelId, and all shape-defining coordinates. A geometry-free payload (only `commandId`, `commandType`, `levelId`) is insufficient and breaks the 3D mesh build.

2. **initTools.ts MUST have a subscriber for every element type dispatched via the bus.** If a bus command succeeds but no `runtime.events.on('xxx.created', ...)` subscriber exists in `initTools.ts`, the legacy store is never populated, no geometry is built, and neither the 3D view nor plan view will show the element.

3. **Every legacy element store's `add()` MUST call `storeEventBus.emit()`** with an `elementType` in `GEOMETRY_ELEMENT_TYPES`. This is the only way the plan-view knows to re-project. The confirmed exception is `CurtainWallStore.add()` (tracked: TODO-CW-STORE-BUS, Wave A16) — the `initTools.ts §P3.1` bridge compensates with an explicit `storeEventBus.emit()` call.

4. **The bridge subscriber MUST have a dedup guard** (`if (store.getById(id)) return;`) to prevent double-adds when the legacy commandManager path also populates the store directly (e.g., columns).

5. **Bus command payload field names MUST match what the plan tool sends.** Field mismatches (e.g., `polygon` vs `boundary` in slabs — Bug FT1-C11-SLAB-BOUNDARY) corrupt the Immer store even when the 3D mesh builds correctly.

6. **`commandManager.execute()` MUST be synchronous in CustomEvent bridge listeners.** It returns `CommandResult`, NOT a `Promise`. Do not add `.then()` or `.catch()` — call it bare. Adding `.catch()` hides the return type mismatch but does not make it asynchronous.

### §10.3 — Bridge removal criteria (Wave A21+)

A bridge for element type X MAY be removed when:
1. The geometry builder for X reads directly from the Immer store (not from the legacy store).
2. The plan-view pipeline subscribes directly to the Immer store change (not via `storeEventBus`).
3. The `bimManager.registerElement()` call is moved into the command handler or a direct Immer store subscriber.

The target state is zero bridges — all geometry builders read from Immer, plan-view subscribes to Immer via the frame scheduler (§6.2.T).

## §11 — Per-Element Pipeline Compliance Matrix (2026-05-19)

This matrix is the normative record of which elements are fully wired through the bus pipeline for all three views (3D, plan, elevation). It MUST be updated whenever a bridge is added, removed, or repaired.

**Column key:**

- **CEB case** — `CommandEventBridge.ts` has a `case 'xxx.create'` with geometry-complete payload
- **initTools bridge** — `initTools.ts` has a `runtime.events.on('xxx.created', ...)` subscriber that calls `LegacyStore.add()`
- **Store `add()` → storeEventBus** — `LegacyStore.add()` emits `storeEventBus` (plan-view trigger)
- **Plan-view tracked** — `elementType` string is in `GEOMETRY_ELEMENT_TYPES` (`ViewDependencyTracker.ts:40`)
- **3D via bus** — 3D mesh builds via bus path (not legacy-only `commandManager.execute()`)
- **Status** — overall bus-path correctness

| Element | CEB case (geometry-complete) | initTools bridge | Store `add()` → storeEventBus | Plan-view tracked | 3D via bus | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Wall** | ✅ `wall.create` + `wall.batch.create` | ✅ §P2.1 | ✅ `WallStore.add()` | ✅ `'wall'` | ✅ | ✅ FULL |

| **Curtain Wall** | ✅ `curtainwall.create` + `curtain-wall.batch.create` | ✅ §P3.1 (+ explicit `storeEventBus.emit`) | ⚠️ `CurtainWallStore.add()` omits storeEventBus — compensated by bridge emit | ✅ `'curtainwall'` | ✅ | ✅ FULL (workaround active — TODO-CW-STORE-BUS) |
| **Ceiling** | ✅ `ceiling.create` + `ceiling.batch.create` | ✅ §P3.2-CL | ✅ `CeilingStore.add()` (line 148) | ✅ `'ceiling'` | ✅ | ✅ FULL |
| **Roof** | ✅ `roof.create` | ✅ §P3.2-RF | ✅ `RoofStore.add()` | ✅ `'roof'` | ✅ | ✅ FULL |
| **Column** | ✅ `column.create` + `column.batch.create` | ✅ §P3.3-CO (dedup: `store.get(id)`) | ✅ `ColumnStore.add()` (line 137) | ✅ `'column'` | ✅ | ✅ FULL |
| **Beam** | ✅ `beam.create` + `beam.batch.create` | ✅ §FT2 | ✅ `BeamStore.add()` (line 63) | ✅ `'beam'` | ✅ | ✅ FULL |
| **Floor** | ✅ `floor.create` | ✅ §P3.2-FL | ✅ `FloorStore.add()` (line 125) | ✅ `'floor'` | ✅ | ✅ FULL |
| **Wall Opening (Door/Window)** | ✅ `wall.opening.create` + `wall.createOpening` | ✅ §P2.3 | ✅ `OpeningStore.add()` | ✅ `'opening'`, `'window'`, `'door'` | ✅ | ✅ FULL |
| **Stair** | ❌ No CEB case (comment: "no initTools subscriber") | ❌ No bridge | ✅ `StairStore.add()` → storeEventBus (line 171) | ✅ `'stair'` | ❌ | ⚠️ LEGACY-ONLY — stair element is created via `commandManager` (legacy path), not bus |
| **Handrail** | ⚠️ `handrail.create` case emits geometry-free payload (levelId only) | ❌ No bridge | ✅ `HandrailStore.add()` → storeEventBus (line 101) | ✅ `'handrail'` | ❌ | ⚠️ LEGACY-ONLY — handrail populated via legacy path; CEB payload insufficient for bridge |
| **Furniture** | ⚠️ `furniture.create` case emits geometry-free payload (levelId only) | ❌ No bridge | ✅ `FurnitureStore.add()` → storeEventBus | ✅ `'furniture'` | ❌ | ⚠️ LEGACY-ONLY — furniture populated via legacy path; CEB payload insufficient for bridge |
| **Lighting** | ⚠️ `lighting.create` case emits geometry-free payload | ❌ No bridge | ❓ Not audited | ❌ Not in `GEOMETRY_ELEMENT_TYPES` | ❌ | ⚠️ OUT-OF-SCOPE — not a geometry element in current schema |
| **Room** | ✅ `room.create` | N/A (room derived, not tool-created) | Via `RoomStore` | ✅ indirect | N/A | ✅ Derived — redetected from walls/slabs |

### §11.1 — Gaps requiring action (Wave A16 / Wave A21)

| Gap | Element(s) | Action required | Sprint |
|---|---|---|---|
| **TODO-CW-STORE-BUS** | Curtain Wall | Fix `CurtainWallStore.add()` to emit `storeEventBus` directly (eliminate bridge workaround) | Wave A16 |
| **STAIR-BUS-MIGRATION** | Stair | Add `stair.create` CEB case with geometry-complete payload; add `initTools.ts §FT-STAIR` bridge; migrate from `commandManager` path | Wave A21 |
| **HANDRAIL-BUS-MIGRATION** | Handrail | Enrich `handrail.create` CEB payload with geometry fields; add `initTools.ts §FT-HANDRAIL` bridge | Wave A21 |
| **FURNITURE-BUS-MIGRATION** | Furniture | Enrich `furniture.create` CEB payload with position/rotation/model; add `initTools.ts §FT-FURN` bridge | Wave A21 |
| **SLAB-BATCH-COORDINATOR** | Slab | Implement `BatchCoordinator.runBatch()` in `CreateSlabBatch.ts` (§7.4) | Wave A21 |
| **HANDLER-OTEL-SPANS** | All 177 handlers | Every handler MUST emit ≥ 1 OTel span (§5.2, C10 §2) | S03 |
| **HANDLER-RUNTIME-EVENTS** | All 177 handlers | Every handler MUST call `runtime.events.emit(eventName, payload)` directly after store mutation (§5.2) — today this is done by CEB, not the handler itself | S03 |

### §11.2 — How to add a new element type (checklist)

When implementing a new element type `xxx`, the following MUST all be completed before the feature is considered done:

```
□ 1. Command handler (plugins/xxx/src/handlers/CreateXxx.ts)
     - Validates all domain invariants
     - Mutates Immer store via produceCommand()
     - Wraps in withHandlerSpan() (C10 §2)
     - Declares affectedStores: ['xxx'] as const

□ 2. CommandEventBridge (packages/runtime-composer/src/CommandEventBridge.ts)
     - case 'xxx.create': with FULL geometry payload (id, levelId, ALL shape coordinates)
     - events.emit('xxx.created', { ...allGeometryFields })
     - case 'xxx.batch.create': emits one 'xxx.created' per element

□ 3. initTools.ts bridge (apps/editor/src/engine/initTools.ts)
     - runtime.events.on('xxx.created', (ev) => { ... })
     - Guards: commandType check, geometry presence check, dedup guard
     - Calls LegacyXxxStore.add({ ...reconstructedFromEv })
     - If LegacyXxxStore.add() does NOT emit storeEventBus: add explicit
       storeEventBus.emit({ elementType: 'xxx', elementId: ev.id, ... })
     - Log: console.log('[initTools] §FT-XXX: xxx mirrored to legacy store', ev.id)

□ 4. Legacy store (packages/core-app-model/src/stores/XxxStore.ts or geometry-xxx/)
     - add() MUST call storeEventBus.emit({ elementType: 'xxx', operation: 'create', ... })
     - elementType string MUST be in GEOMETRY_ELEMENT_TYPES (ViewDependencyTracker.ts:40)

□ 5. ViewDependencyTracker (packages/core-app-model/src/views/ViewDependencyTracker.ts)
     - Add 'xxx' to GEOMETRY_ELEMENT_TYPES Set if it has plan-view geometry

□ 6. Verify §11 matrix — update this table

□ 7. Verify §8.4 runtime gate — test in split-view, confirm element appears in plan ≤ 400ms
```
