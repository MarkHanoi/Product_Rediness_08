/**
 * §FIX-DEAD-MOVE-VERB-REFUSE (W3-4, Class A "dead verb") — why `column.move` now REFUSES.
 *
 * This handler produced a correct Immer patch against `ctx.stores.column`, reported
 * SUCCESS, and changed nothing any user could ever see. In production the bus's
 * storesProvider (apps/editor/src/bootstrap.ts:92-97) hands it a snapshot of the FRESH
 * plugin DTO store built by PluginRegistry — not the legacy geometry singleton that the
 * fragment builders, the 2-D plan projector, the IFC exporter and persistence all read.
 * Only `<family>.created` is mirrored across; there is no update bridge in either
 * direction.
 *
 * IT IS ALSO A DEAD PARALLEL PATH. No production surface dispatches it. The ONE table
 * that decides what a move dispatches is `MOVE_COMMAND_BY_TYPE`
 * (apps/editor/src/engine/transforms/elementMove.ts:102-127), and the 3-D gizmo's own
 * list is the 13 `dragDispatch(...)` sites in `registerTransformDragHandler.ts`.
 * Neither names `column.move`. The `plugins/cross` cascade rules that synthesise it are
 * inert: `CascadeRunner` is registered nowhere in production (only in
 * packages/command-bus/__tests__/cascade.test.ts and commented-out examples).
 * DISPOSITION (recorded 2026-08-12, ADR-0323 / BIM30 R0 — see
 * docs/04-reference/BIM30-DISPOSITION-DOCKET.md): CascadeRunner passed its
 * promotion test (packages/command-bus/__tests__/cascade-promotion.test.ts:
 * deterministic / non-mutating / set-stable under iteration-order shuffle)
 * and is PROMOTED as the cascade branch of the future ConsequencePlanner
 * (BIM30-REASONING-LOOP-PLAN R2). It stays unregistered until R2 wires it,
 * so these cascade rules remain unreachable TODAY by recorded decision,
 * not neglect.
 * So refusing costs a user nothing, and leaving it silent keeps a SECOND, lying
 * mutation path alive against P6.
 *
 * THE UNDO HAZARD THIS ALSO CLOSES. `affectedStores` is `['column']`, and CommandBus
 * pushes that key verbatim onto the ring buffer. `buildUndoStoreMap()`
 * (apps/editor/src/engine/undo/performUndoRedo.ts) maps it to the GEOMETRY store. So a
 * ring-first Ctrl+Z handed the geometry store an INVERSE carrying the plugin store's
 * stale prior value, for a forward write geometry never saw. Reproduced and pinned in
 * apps/editor/__tests__/deadMoveVerbAuthoritativeState.test.ts.
 *
 * DECISION: REFUSE, not retire. `CapabilityRefusal` / `CHAT_UNAVAILABLE` /
 * `ChatCommandClassification` name these verbs, and
 * `tools/ga-gate/check-chat-capability-coverage.ts` requires every such name to be a
 * REGISTERED bus command — retiring would make chat's own refusal cite a verb that does
 * not exist.
 *
 * The refusal lives in `canExecute` deliberately: CommandBus throws there before
 * touching either undo stack, so no geometry-keyed PatchPair is ever armed. Payload
 * validation runs FIRST (`validatePayload`) so a malformed payload still gets its own
 * specific reason rather than this one.
 *
 * `execute()` is left intact: it is a correct plugin-store mutation for a host that
 * binds the authoritative store under this key. `canExecute` is the gate the bus honours.
