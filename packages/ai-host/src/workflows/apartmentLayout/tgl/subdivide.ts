// TGL P3b — subdivision: rooms → footprints.
//
// Packs the bubble-graph rooms into the shell's decomposition rects (P1) and
// squarifies (P3a) each rect's share, so every room gets exactly one axis-aligned
// footprint that lies inside the real shell — never a thin full-depth strip and
// never floating through an L-shape notch.
//
// Allocation is deterministic and public-first: rects are taken largest-first and
// rooms are streamed in bubble-graph order (hall/living/kitchen → corridor →
// private), so public space lands in the biggest rect near the entrance and the
// private zone flows into the smaller rects. squarify scales each rect's room set
// to fill that rect EXACTLY, so the footprints tile the shell (total area ≈ shell
// area) with no gaps or overlaps. Pure: imports only sibling TGL types.
//
// §SINGLE-RECT-CARVE (2026-05-28, architect feedback) — when the shell is a
// single rectangle AND the program has a corridor + ≥1 private room, the
// shell is PRE-CARVED into [public-zone | corridor strip 1.2 m | private-zone]
// before squarify runs. The corridor is forced to its real-architectural shape
// (a 1.0–1.4 m wide strip running the long axis of the shell) and every
// private room ends up sharing a wall with it. PLUS, when the program also
// has a master + ensuite, the ensuite is CARVED FROM INSIDE the master's
// squarified rect after subdivision, so the master/ensuite door (the only
// permitted access to the ensuite) ALWAYS lands on a real shared wall.
//
// Coordinates: metres, plan frame { x, z }. Rounded to 1e-6 at the boundary (§6).
